AGONCILLC \nThe common traits are probably basical¬ \nly Malayan and characterize the Filipinos as a \npeople. \nOne patent Filipino trait that imme¬ \ndiately commends itself to the foreigner is his \nhospitality. All peoples the world over are \nhospitable in their own way, but Filipino \nhospitality is something that is almost a fault. \nThis hospitality to a fault has been misunder¬ \nstood by many foreigners, particularly by the \nSpanish adventurers of the previous century, \nwho thought that such show of profuse \nhospitality was a form of inferiority and \nobsequiousness. \nThe Filipino has very dose family ties. \nThe family has been the unit of society and \neverything revolves around it. The Filipino \nfamily ordinarily consists of the grandparents, \nthe parents, and the children. The father is \nthe head of the family, but while he rules, the \nmother governs. For it is the mother that \nreigns in the home: she is the educator, the \nfinancial officer, the laundrywoman, and the \ncook. \nRespect for the elders is one Filipino \ntrait that has remained in the book of"

    "content": "PREFACE TO THE EIGHTH EDITION \nThis new edition of History of the Filipino People is a ful¬ \nfillment of the wish of the late Professor Teodoro A. Agoncillo \nwho had indicated in various occasions to members of his family \nand friends the need to update the text in response to changing \nsituations. One of the changes effected is the replacement of the \nchapters written by the junior co-author and the incorporation of \nother materials the senior author would have-done. \nThe difficult task of revision was assumed by the family \nwith the invaluable help of scholar friends who had given more \nthan casual time, efforts, and commitments to bring out the \nnecessary changes in the text. Especially acknowledged with \nenduring appreciation are the many acts of kindness and assistance \nextended to the family by Dr. Bemardita R. Churchill, Dr. Isagani \nR. Medina, and Dr. Samuel K. Tan — all from the Department of \nHistory, University of the Philippines, Diliman, and intimate \nassociates of the late professor. \nThis eighth edition, which is offered to teachers, students, \nand readers of Philippine history, with the same sense of purpose \nthat had marked the late professor's works is one of the affection¬ \nate tributes that his family wishes to offer to his memory. \nTEODORO V AGONCILLO, III \n(For the family of the late \nTeodoro A.

    "content": "THE SETTING \n1 \nThe Philippines is an archipelago consisting of more than \n7,000 islands and islets stretching almost a thousand miles from \nnorth to south. The land surface is 114,830 square statute miles \nand is criss-crossed with mountains and drained by small river \nsystems. Volcanic in origin, the mountain ranges “form the \ncircuit and watersheds of the Pacific basin of the earth’s sur¬ \nface.”* \nMountain Systems.—There are three large ranges in the \nmountain system of Luzon which form ramparts around the \nCentral Plains. The Caraballo del Sur, which forms the nucleus \nof the system, has its highest peak at the intersection of the \nboundaries of Abra, Ilocos Norte, and Cagayan. The Caraballos \nOccidentales divide into the Cordillera Norte and Cordillera Central \nand traverse the region west of the Cagayan River. The Sierra \nMadre, also known as the Pacific coast range, begins at Baler, \nQuezon, and crosses Isabela, Nueva Vizcaya, and Cagayan. This \nis the longest continuous range in the Philippines. The mountain \nranges of the eastern and southeastern provinces of Luzon extend \nfrom the Caraballo de Baler to San Bernardino Strait in the \nsouth, culminating in May on Volcano in Albay and Bulusan \nVolcano in Sorsogon. \nThe Zambales range starts at Cape Bolinao and follows the \nChina Sea coast to the Bataan Peninsula. The Tagaytay range \npasses through Cavite and Batangas and, with Mt. Makiling, \nforms the mountain system of the southern Tagalog region. \nThe Mindoro mountain range begins at Mt. Halcon and is \ndivided into three ranges: the northwest ending at Calavite \nPoint, a landmark of ships passing between Manila Bay and \nMindoro Strait; the east, which originates from Lake Naujan; \nand the west, which follows the Mindoro Strait. \nNegros in the Visayas is divided into two by a range run¬ \nning from northwest to southeast, with Kanlaon Volcano as \n* Bureau of Insular Affairs, War Department.

Panay has a range running from north to \nsouth that separates Antique from Iloilo, Capiz, and Aklan. \nMindanao has four distinct ranges: the Surigao range which \nfollows the contours of the Pacific coast; the Butuan range which \nextends to the south and forms the watershed of the Agusan \nRiver on the east and the Pulangui River on the west; the central- \nwestern ranges of which Mt. Apo is the highest; and the Western \nrange which begins west of Iligan Bay and ends on the shore \nof Basilan Strait. \nRiver Systems.—The Philippines has extensive but small \nriver systems which are mostly delineated by the mountain ranges. \nThe fluvial system of Luzon is represented by (1) the Rio Grande \nde Cagayan and its tributaries, which drain the Cagayan Valley; \n(2) the Agno Grande which drains Benguet and the valleys of \nNueva Ecija, Pangasinan, and Tarlac; (3) the Abra River system, \nwhich receives its tributaries from the Cordillera and drains \nLepanto, Bontoc, and Abra; and (4) the Rfo Grande de Pampanga \nand its tributaries, which drain the fertile valleys of Nueva Ecija, \nPampanga, and Bulacan. \nMindanao has the largest river system in the Philippines. \nThe Rio Grande de Mindanao drains the central basin of Min¬ \ndanao and receives the waters of two flakes. Agusan, which is \nsecond to the Rfo Grande, drains the basin of Surigao. \nVolcanoes and Earthquakes.—Volcanoes dot the three geo¬ \ngraphic regions of the country and have been for centuries one \nof the natural causes of destruction of life and property. At \nleast ten of these volcanoes are considered active; the rest are \ndormant. The most famous of these are, from north to south, \nIraya in Batanes Island; Taal in Batangas; Banahaw in Quezon; \nMayon in Albay; Hibok-Hibok in Camiguin Island; Makaturing \nin Lanao; and Apo in Davao. Of these volcanoes, Mayon has \nbeen the most active. It has erupted more than thirty times \nsince 1615, while Taal Volcano, the smallest in the world and \nsituated in the middle of Taal Lake, has erupted no less than \nthirty-three times. Its most destructive eruption took place \non January 30, 1911, which killed more than 1,300 persons. \nThe eruption which took place in early dawn of September \n28, 1965 buried six barrios and led to the loss of 300 lives. The \neruption of July 5 and after, 1966 did little damage to life and \nproperty. The last eruption took place on September 3, 1976."

    "content": "THE SETTING \n3 \nThe Philippines lies within the Pacific seismic belt and has \nconsequently experienced severe earthquakes, though these have \nnot been as destructive as those that had rocked Japan. Manila \nexperienced a severe earthquake in 1937 when many buildings \nin the commercial district were partly destroyed. The earth¬ \nquake of August 2, 1968 was so violent that an apartment build¬ \ning collapsed, killing hundreds of people. One of the most de¬ \nstructive earthquakes in Philippine history occurred on June 3, \n1863, when the Manila Cathedral and hundreds of government \nstructures and residential houses collapsed and many people \nwere killed, including the famous Filipino priest, Dr. Pedro Pablo \nPelaez. Another destructive earthquake occurred on April 1, \n1955 when the Visayas and Mindanao were rocked by a series \nof quakes ranging from Intensity III to Intensity VIII. Millions \nof pesos and hundreds of lives were lost in the region around \nLake Lanao, Mindanao. By far the most destructive earth¬ \nquake that occurred in the Philippines was the one that struck \nMindanao on August 17, 1976. Its Intensity was VIII. This \nearthquake triggered a tidal wave that rendered 90,000 persons \nhomeless, 3,000 dead, and more than 3,000 missing or presumed \nto be dead. Hundreds of millions worth of property were de¬ \nstroyed, thus making rehabilitation a difficult task. In the \nface of this disaster, President Marcos announced that the \nFilipinos would stand on their own feet and would not accept \nany foreign aid, especially aid with strings attached. \nCoastline.—Aside from the ruggedness of the land mass, \nthe Philippines has an irregular coastline that extends to about \n10,850 statute miles, twice as long as that of continental United \nStates. Such irregularity results in contours that make for nu¬ \nmerous fine harbors and landlocked straits. Manila Bay, which \nhas an area of a little more than 700 square miles and a circum¬ \nference of 120 miles, is one of the finest natural harbors in the \nworld. All big islands and a host of small islands have natural \nharbors that can accommodate large ships. In stormy weather, \nthese harbors, located strategically from north to south, have \nbeen the refuge of ships in distress. \nProducts and Natural Resources.—The Philippine* is rich \nin natural resources that are as yet largely undeveloped. Its \nfertile plains and rich valleys produce diverse crops a few of \nwhich are produced for export and the rest for local consump¬ \ntion. Rice, the staple crop of the country, is produced largely \nin the Central Plains of Luzon, but the total production is not"

The still primitive way of agriculture is one of \nthe causes of the failure of the Philippines to produce enough \nrice for export. However, a breakthrough in rice production was \nmade during the first four years of President Ferdinand Marcos’ \nadministration when the so-called “miracle rice” was developed. \nOther products, however, have been raised for export. Cop¬ \nra, abaca, gums, resins, rubber, and sugar have found ready \nmarkets abroad. Lumber, minerals, and metals have been ex¬ \nported in large quantities to swell Philippine exports to an \naverage of about P800,000,000. Mining, which is a basic in¬ \ndustry, produces more than 700 million pesos worth of minerals. \nMetallic minerals, such as copper, gold, silver, iron, lead, zinc, \nmanganese, and chromium are exploited for their commercial \nvalue, while the non-metallic minerals like salt, coal, clay, as¬ \nbestos, sulphur, gravel, limestone, and gypsum are so far not \nyet exploited for large-scale export. It is suspected that oil is \npresent in some Philippine sites, but attempts to locate these \nsites have so far been unsuccessful. \nThe Philippine forests, which cover some 40,000 square \nmiles, produce timber for local consumption and export. Phil¬ \nippine hardwoods are known the world over.

Centuries of cultural and \ncommercial contacts with the countries of Asia and almost four \ncenturies of domination by Western Powers have made the Fili¬ \npino comparatively sophisticated. There is in him a blending \nof the East and the West, so that his character exhibits curious \ncontradictions which foreigners are apt to misunderstand. Doubt¬ \nless, the Filipino at the coming of the Spaniards was brown¬ \nskinned like his Malay forebears. With Spanish colonization, \nhowever, there appeared a kind of Filipino who was obviously \nthe result of the not-so-licit relations between the conqueror \nand the conquered. This light-skinned and high-nosed Filipino \nmultiplied with the coming of the Americans.'

When one says mestizo, the \nobvious implication is that the person spoken of is Spanish- \nFilipino. All other half-breeds are qualified by the nationality \nof their parents. Thus, a Filipino with an American father or \nmother is called an American mestizo; with a Chinese father \nor mother, a Chinese mestizo; with an Indian father or mother, \nan Indian mestizo, and so on down the line. \nBetween the mestizo and the “native”, there has been a \nbarrier of feeling that borders on hostility. This feeling has \nits origin in the late Spanish period or, more specifically, during \nthe nineteenth century, when the mestizo, by virtue of his social \nand financial status, looked down upon the “native” as a boor. \nThe “native” naturally resented this attitude and in turn in¬ \nfused the term mestizo with unsavory connotations, e.g., pre¬ \ntentious, boastful, arrogant, etc. In the mind of the “native”, \nthe mestizo was insolent: his posture of superiority to the “na¬ \ntive” arose from his awareness of his Spanish origins. But \nwhile thus striking a superior posture before the “native”, the \nmestizo almost always felt inferior to the “pure” Spaniard who \nconsidered him so far below him as not to be taken seriously. \nThe mestizo, therefore, during the Spanish period, was Janus¬ \nfaced: he was a Spaniard before a “native”, and a Filipino be¬ \nfore a Spaniard.1 \nThe uneasy feeling between the “native” and the mestizo \nstill exists, although very much watered down. It flares up \nonce in a while, as when an eminent columnist, at the height \nof the discussions on the American bases question early in \n1959, called down a senator by claiming that the latter, being a \nmestizo, could not be expected to defend the rights of the Fili¬ \npinos in so far as the question was concerned. Surely, being a \nmestizo cannot be taken as an argument against the senator, \nbut the columnist, in calling him down, merely brought to the \nmental surface what may be loosely termed the “racial” expe¬ \nrience, that is to say, the old role of the mestizo in Philippine \nsociety and the age-old feeling of the “native” against the \nmestizo. \nCommon Traits.—It is difficult, if not impossible, to de¬ \nfine what a Filipino is.

The common \ntraits are probably basically Malay and characterize the Fili¬ \npinos as a people. \nOne patent Filipino trait that immediately commends itself \nto the foreigner is his hospitality. All peoples the world over \nare hospitable in their own way, but Filipino hospitality is \nsomething that is * almost a fault. Are yoiP a stranger who has \nlost your way? Knock at the door of even the humblest \nrustic and he offers you his home. In other climes you might \nbe suspected of being a hoodlum or a poseur. Consequently, \nyou might be looked upon with suspicion. Call it naivete but \nthe Filipino opens his heart to you, a complete stranger, and \noffers you the best in his kitchen and bed chamber. He makes \nthe bed for you and asks you, usually with a profusion of apo¬ \nlogies, to make yourself feel “at home”, while he, the host, \nsleeps on the cold floor. He prepares water for your morning \nablution, waits upon you at the table, and makes life worth \nliving for you. \nPerhaps you happen to drop in at an unholy hour of the \nday or night. Sensing that you are hungry, he prepares the \nbest food for you, ignoring the fact that there would not be \nenough for the next supper of his family. Meanwhile, he gives \n\"you something to while away your time. You hear him or his \nwife puttering about the kitchen desperately hurrying^up the \n- preparation of the food in order not to keep you waiting. There \nis always a sense of urgency in his movements, for he does \nnot want to inconvenience you. He makes you feel that he is \nhonored by your invasion of his privacy at an unholy hour of \nthe day or night. This hospitality to a fault has been misunder¬ \nstood by many foreigners, particularly by the Spanish adven¬ \nturers of the past century, who thought that such show of \nprofuse hospitality was a form of inferiority and obsequious¬ \nness. Thus, Rizal records that some Spaniards of the last century \nused to regale their hearers in the Peninsula with tales about the \n“Indios” whose hospitality they savored and abused and, having \nabused it, proceeded to tell their hearers that they fell “victims” \nto the wiles of the Filipino women. \nThe Filipino has very close family ties. The family has \nbeen the unit of society and everything revolves around it. The \nFilipino family ordinarily consists of the grandparents, the pa-"

For it is the mother \nthat reigns in the home: she is the educator, the financial of¬ \nficer, the accountant, the censor^ the laundrywoman, and the \ncook. But over and above the “ruler” and the “governor” are \nthe grandparents, whose opinions and decisions oh all impor¬ \ntant matters are sought. Will a new-born child be baptized? \nThe grandparents are consulted and what they say carries much \nweight. Ignore them and you risk their stinging rebuke. Is the \nchild sick?

Why, then, should you risk \nthe life of the child by calling in somebody whose experience \nis limited to turning gadgets he, an old man, does not under¬ \nstand?

You wring your hands in sheer frustration, \nappeal to him in the name of modem science — and get a stem \nlook or a verbal dressing down for your efforts. The “tyranny” \nof the elders is such that the Filipino family, in spite of the \ninroads of modem civilization, has remained basically the same. \nRespect for the elders is one Filipino trait that has re¬ \nmained in the book of unwritten laws.

Yours is the knowledge; theirs the wisdom — they have \ndrunk more water than you have! Their decision must, there¬ \nfore, be sought on all important matters that affect the whole \nfamily, for what happens to one of the members affects the \nrest. There is, then, collective responsibility in the family. It \nis this closeness of family ties, in particular, the collective \nresponsibility, that accounts for the late development of Filipino \nnationalism. For no matter how cruelly and unjustly a member \nof the family had been treated, the elders cautioned the victim \nto be patient: remember, they used to say, that not only you \nbut all of us will suffer if you retaliate. And the poor man, real¬ \nizing the consequences of his planned action, controlled his emo¬ \ntions, swallowed his pride, satisfied himself with biting his lo¬ \nwer lip, and sheepishly bowed to the will of the elders. Rizal \npainted this common family scene during the Spanish regime \nin his El Filibusterismo, in the chapter “Cabesang Tales”. \nRespect for the elders includes respect for the elder brother \nor sister. It is the responsibility of the elder brother to perform \nthe duties of the father and mother to the younger members of \nthe family. One finds that among Filipino families the elder \nbrother (or sister) sacrifices even his career for the sake of \nthe young ones who must have an education. Even after his \nmarriage, the elder brother sets aside a small part of his salary \nfor his younger brothers and sisters. The latter, in turn, are \nexpected to look up to their elder brother with awe and respect. \nKissing the hands of parents and old relatives or neighbors as \na sign of respect is extended to the elder brother or sister. \nAmong “old” and “respectable families”, even cousins kiss the \nhands of their elder cousins as a sign of respect. \nAnd this brings us to that aspect of Filipino family life \nwhich is both reasonable and unreasonable. Since collective re¬ \nsponsibility characterizes the Filipino family, it follows that the \nbetter-off member has to take care not only of his immediate \nfamily but also of other relatives. It is not uncommon to see \nthe poor relations go to their employed kin to ask for money."

To reject them is to court disaster: \nthe poor relations will start a whispering campaign against the \n“tight-fisted” relative. If there is anything that a Filipino fears, \nit is the charge of being a “bad” relative. This custom of tak¬ \ning care of the poor relations is so deeply ingrained in the \nFilipino character that one may trace the root of graft and cor¬ \nruption to the closeness of family ties. Right or wrong, the \nfamily comes first and foremost. Hence the Filipino who rises \nto a position of power is confronted with the problem of pro¬ \nviding for his relatives, whose number, by the way, increases \nin proportion to the power and influence one exercises. \nThe Filipino is naturally fatalistic. No amount of expostu¬ \nlation on the virtues of science or logic can dislodge him from \nhis idea of fatalism. He believes that whatever happens to \nhim is the work of Fate. This fatalism is best symbolized in \nthe phrase “Bahala na,” a phrase that defies translation but \nwhich may be rendered loosely as “come what may.” Can you \ngo through that wall of fire? Bahala na. Are you sure you can \nconvince him to give up his plan of leaving home? Bahala na. \nThere are dangers ahead, don’t be so foolish as to rush in \nwhere angels fear to tread. Bahala na.

He is big and strong; can you fight \nhim? Bahala na. Such fatalism has bred in the Filipino a \nsense of resignation. It is thus that he faces disaster or tragedy \nwith resignation. He appears indifferent in the face of graft \nand corruption. He appears impassive in the face of personal \nmisfortune. Yet this “jBahala na” attitude prevents him from \nbeing a crackpot. \nLoyalty to a friend or to a benefactor is one trait that is \nvery strong in the Filipino. Do him a little favor and he re¬ \nmembers you to the end of his days. For to the Filipino, friend¬ \nship is sacred and implies mutual help under any circumstances. \nA friend is expected to come to the aid not only of a personal \nfriend, but also of the latter’s family. A man’s friend is con¬ \nsidered a member of the family and is expected to share its \ntribulations as well as its prosperity and happiness.

Maintaining that he, as soldier or as civilian during the \nlast World War, fought side by side with the Yankee, the Filipino \nbelieves, rightly or wrongly, that he deserves more generous \naid from the United States than, say, the Japanese, who was \na former common enemy. To the Filipino, it is hardly conceivable \nthat the United States should turn out to be an “Migrate”, know¬ \ning as she does that he stood by her in the darkest hour. This \nattitude, on the other hand, is beyond the comprehension of the \nAmerican, for the latter’s understanding of friendship is different \nfrom that of the Filipino. The American is ruthlessly businesslike \nand will not allow sentimentalism to stand in the way of fulfilling \nhis destiny or objective. This “ruthlessness” the Filipino does \nnot understand. Hence the continued misunderstanding between \nthe Filipino and the American with respect to material aid. \nThe American, then, suspects that the Filipino is sensitive. \nHe is. He would not tolerate anyone berating his countryman. \nHe is easily piqued when a foreigner, for instance, makes a sweep¬ \ning generalization that is not flattering to the Filipinos, no matter \nhow true the observation may be.

It is \nonly in recent years that the Filipino businessmen and merchants \nare trying to get rid of the segurista attitude. \nThe Filipino, being childlike, is naturally curious. But his \ncuriosity is tainted with sympathy. There certainly is nothing \nmalicious in his inquiries about one’s health, about one’s child¬ \nren, about one’s salary, and so forth. Not infrequently is a \nsophisticated Filipino embarrassed when asked, casually and \nwith an air of innocent abandon, where he works and how much \nhe earns. An old woman of little Spanish breeding once asked \na college graduate: “Poco mas o menos, how much do you \nmake?” The poor man blushed and hesitantly answered, try¬ \ning to avoid the horn of the bull, “Oh, just enough for me and \nmy wife.” Poco mas o menos?” the hag insisted.

Even his closest friend cannot kiss his wife \nwith impunity on the pretext that it is a “brotherly” kiss. The \nFilipino, therefore, requires complete faith and loyalty of his \nwife or sweetheart. A deviation from this unwritten law often¬ \ntimes leads to a bloody mess, as the cases of two Filipinos in the \nUnited States attest. In the one case, the Filipino, a woman, \n“accidentally” shot her gallivanting husband; in the second, the \nFilipino, a man, was accused of butchering his American sweet¬ \nheart. Bloody killings, often enough reported in the daily news¬ \npapers, are frequent and are usually the upshot of jealousy, for \nto a Filipino, blood is required to wash the stain on his honor. \nThis may seem bloody enough to a Westerner, but to a Filipino \nin whose veins flows the Malay “hot” blood, to kill or be killed \nis an easy way to avenge his honor. \nThe Filipino, too, is regionalistic. He does not think in \nterms of national boundaries but in regional oneness. This feel¬ \ning is an extension of the closeness of family ties. Invariably, \nthe Filipino believes that the person known to him, no matter \nhow bad, is better than the one unknown to him no matter \nhow good.

Since* there were few Spaniards in the Philippines, \nthey pressed into service, say, the Pampangos, to put down an \nIlocano uprising. A Pampango revolt, on the other hand, was \nput down by the Ilocano soldiers. A Tagalog revolt was usually \nput down by the Pampangos under the leadership of the Span¬ \niards, and so on. Thus, instead of uniting the Filipinos as a \npeople, the Spaniards succeeded in dividing them by appealing \nto their regionalistic pride and prejudices. \nProbably the most discussed trait of the Filipino, especially \nby the white foreigners and by some Filipino sociologists and \npsychologists who carry around their bags of esoteric terms, \nis the sense of pakikisama. Simple as the term may appear to \nthe merely learned, this Filipino trait has not been fully under¬ \nstood, especially in its connotations. In its original connota¬ \ntion, pakikisama may be translated loosely as the intensive \nsignification of camaraderie or spirit of comradeship, the main \nelements of which are unselfishness and good faith. There is, \ntherefore, no element of deceit, or dishonesty, or subversion of \njustice, attached to the term. Thus the terms mabuting mato- \nsama and its opposite, masamang makisama, really refer to a \nperson’s way of dealing with his fellowmen: if he is selfish, \nor if he is incapable of empathy, or if he considers himself \n“an island entire of itself”, he is described as “masamang ma¬ \nkisama”.

On the other hand, he is “masamang makisama” who \nis too honest and just j;o pervert justice; who refuses ta kow¬ \ntow to imbeciles and morons with high administrative positions; \nwho insists on merit and merit alone, not on subservience or \npolitical or personal connections, as the basis of promotion; or \nwho refuses to steal from the public treasury in order to have \nsomething to give to his querida or to his lazy friends and rela¬ \ntives. \nThus, in Filipino society today, the most popular and highly \nrespected people are not the honest intellectuals and artists, but \nthe “respectable” robbers in high public positions; the experts \nin issuing press releases praising themselves for fictitious achieve¬ \nments; the crooked public relations men who are adept at \ntwisting facts in order to make an idiot appear a genius in \npublic; and the unprincipled politicians who have never heard \nof decency and honor. The beautiful Filipino trait of paki- \nkisama has, therefore, been denuded of its nobility by the \npolitical imperatives and by the perverted sense of values that \nhave dominated the character of many Filipinos precisely since \nthe last World War. That noble trait has disappeared from the \nurban centers and can only be found in its pristine form in the \n“backward” hamlets where the people have either been un¬ \ntouched by “civilization” or have been able to defend success¬ \nfully their simple life against the inroads of crass materialism. \nSuch is the profile of the Filipino.

These traits, which may be termed \nregional, have been the upshot of economic and social factors. \nThus, in poor isolated regions the inhabitants are frugal and \nindustrious; while in more opulent areas the people are known \nfor their careless abandon and love of the finer things of life. \nBut some characteristic regional traits are, however, difficult \nto explain in precise economic or social terms. \nLet us then begin Horn the north and work our way to the \nsouth. \nFrom the north comes the Ilocano or Samtoy, as he wants \nto be called. An excursion into the northern region reveals \nthat the Samtoy has spilled into the non-Ilocano provinces of \nAbra, Cagayan, Nueva Vizcaya, northern Nueva Ecija, Panga- \nsinan, Zambales, and a part of Tarlac. The Ilocos region is \nhemmed in on one side by forbidding mountain ranges and on \nthe other by the restless sea, so that economic opportunities are \nlimited. The small piece of land that he cultivates is not suf¬ \nficiently fertile to yield abundant crops. Such an environment \ncould only produce adventurous, industrious, hardy, patient, and \nfrugal people. Economic pressure forces him to migrate to \nsome greener valleys either in Mindanao or in Hawaii and con¬ \ntinental United States. There, because of his patience, industry, \nand frugality, he carves out his fortune and most of the time \nsucceeds. He is not one to stay put in a locality if better op¬ \nportunities in some land beckon. It is for this reason that one \nfinds the Samtoy everywhere in the Philippines. \nSamtoy frugality is proverbial and compares favorably \nwith that of the Scot. It has been the custom of the Filipino \nto foot the bill if he happens to invite his companions to, say, \na dinner or a round of drinks. It would be difficult for the \nSamtoy, under the circumstances, to dig into his pockets to take \ncharge of the situation. This is because he earns his money the \nhard way, and he is not one to nullify his efforts by being a \nspendthrift. \nMention has been made of the barren north. Nature not \nbeing so kind to him, the Samtoy finds his surroundings not \nconducive to humor. Anybody who sees humor in such kind of \nenvironment is a bom humorist. The Samtoy is not a bom \nhumorist. He takes life seriously and considers it an object of \nstruggle. That is why he appears sluggish and shy, and creates"

This lumbering characteristic of the \nSamtoy is shown not only in his physical movements, but also \nin his writings. He is not the lyrical type; he is, rather, the \nepic type. Thus it is that he developed epic poetry, as exemplified \nby Biag ni Lam-ang (life of Lam-ang), a kind of poetry that \nrequires sustained effort. Then, too, while his mood is medita¬ \ntive his style is, nevertheless, rather elephantine. Compare the \nprose of such Samtoy stalwarts as Salvador P. Lopez, Leopoldo \nY. Yabesf Manuel E. Arguilla, and Consorcio Boije, with, say, \nthat of Federico Mangahas, E. Aguilar Cruz, Carmen G. Nakpil, \nN. V M. Gonzales, Teodoro M. Locsin, Nick Joaquin and other \nnon-Samtoys, and one immediately senses the dragging style of \nthe former and the easy, mellifluous ripple of the latter’s prose. \nOf all Filipinos, the Samtoy is the most regionalistic. \nAs one goes down to the Central Plains and to the area \nimmediately south of it, one finds the Tagalog belt. It com¬ \nprises the provinces of Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Bataan, a small \npart of Tarlac, Rizal, Laguna, Cavite, Batangas, Quezon, and \nthe islands of Marinduque and Mindoro. Manila, the polit¬ \nical capital of the Philippines and the center of cultural and \ncommercial life, is at the heart of the region. It is this his¬ \ntorical accident that makes the Tagalog feel “superior” to the \nrest of the Filipinos. He is neither frugal nor extravagant. \nHis code of ethics is strict, his pride fierce. The ties that bind \nhim to his home are so strong that, unlike the Samtoy or the \nVisayan, he prefers to stay put in his homeland than migrating to \ngreener valleys to carve out his fortune. The result is that among \nthe Filipinos he has developed the strongest tendency to live with \nhis parents or in-laws even after his marriage. \nLess concerned with his environment than his Samtoy brother, \nthe Tagalog enjoys the finer things of life. He is at once a lover, \na born poet and a musician. But unlike the Samtoy whose poetry \nis the sustained epic, the poetry of the Tagalog is lyrical. He is \na dreamer and takes the slightest opportunity to burst out into \na declamation. Hence the sing-song nature of the Tagalog dec¬ \nlamation and the impassioned balagtasan (poetical joust). It is \nno wonder, then, that the best lyricists are found in his region. \nJose de la Cruz, popularly known as Huseng Sisiw, Francisco \nBalagtas, and Jose Corazon de Jesus, in Tagalog; Fernando Ma."

Recto, in Spanish; and Jose Garcia Villa and Nick Joaquin, \nin English, exemplify the lyrical temper of the Tagalog. The \nTagalogs also excel in music. The greatest Filipino composers \ncome from the Tagalog region. \nFarther south, in the Bicol region, the Bicolano is known \nfor his even temper and religiosity. Kindly like the Visayan, \nhe views life with studied calmness and seldom shows his rough \nedges; But, like the Visayan, he knows how to enjoy life and \nto take its offerings with philosophical equanimity. He is fond \nof spicy food and no food is good to him which is noj; liberally \nsprinkled with spices, particularly red pepper. Whether this \npredilection is a sign of bravery or of the ability to suffer is \ndifficult to ascertain. One thing, however, is definite: when \nthe Bicolano is not enjoying mundane life to the hilt he is con¬ \ntemplating it in the church or seminary. Many Filipino taxi \ndancers and priests come from the Bicol region. \nThe islands south and southwest of Luzon belong to the Vi¬ \nsayan. He is a happy-go-lucky man more interested in the here \nand now than in the past or the future. He exceeds the Tagalog \nin his love of the finer things of life, so much so that, in con¬ \ntrast with the Samtoy, he is ready to spend his last peso to \nenjoy life to its last drop. Because he is not compelled by his \nenvironment to work half as much as his Samtoy brother, the \nVisayan is a spendthrift. But like his brother in the north, he \nis adventurous and is afflicted with wanderlust. The Visayan \ngirl, unlike her Tagalog sister, can leave home without com¬ \npunction to follow the gleam of adventure. For this reason, she \nis more self-reliant than the Tagalog. \nThe Visayan is a hedonist. Give him a jug of tuba and a \npiece of dried fish and he will sing the wilderness into Paradise. \nHe is a lover like the Tagalog, but he expresses his consuming \npassion in music, not in poetry. Thus, armed with a banduria, a \nukelele or a guitar, he forgets his sorrows, even his hunger, if \nhe is poor, by caressing the strings of his musical instrument \nand singing to its accompaniment. He may not know the dif¬ \nference between a do and a mi on paper, but he can put together \nthe notes of the scale to produce lilting, coquettish music. \nTo the extreme south lies Muslimland.

He \nis easily the best friend one can have and, certainly, the worst \nenemy. He is hardy like the Samtoy and like the latter produced \nepics. He is proud of his culture and does not offer meek apologies \nfor it. Thus, while a large part of the Philippines was being sub¬ \njugated and Christianized by the conquistadores, the proud \nMuslim of the south guarded his citadel, swept the seas with his \nfast vinta to protect himself from the Spanish version of Christian¬ \nity and culture, and fought courageously against the Spaniard, \nlater, against the American, in defense of his religion and freedom. \nOne wonders why the Muslim brother has not been integ¬ \nrated into the Philippine body politic. There are obvious rea¬ \nsons. One is that as a non-Christian who has for centuries \nstruggled for his individual identity he has come to suspect his \nChristian brother of betrayal, for the latter was used by the \nconquerors in their attempts to obliterate Muslim culture and \nreligion. Consequently, the Muslim casts suspicious eyes on his \nChristian brother who, he thinks, is afflicted with Messianic \ndelusion. There is nothing more abominable to the Muslim than \nto be told to discard his “Moro” way of life. Then, too, the \nvarious governments of the Philippines, from the Spanish pe¬ \nriod down to recent times, had utterly neglected the Muslim, \nlet alone the other minorities. Because of his fierce love of his \nculture and religion, the Muslim is looked down upon as an \naberration — a “Moro”, with all its ugly implications. The result \nis that he becomes antagonistic to any attempt to bring him \nto the Christian society’s fold, for he believes that the attempt \nis made not because he is loved, but because his conversion to \nthe Christian way of life is necessary. The proud Muslim does \nnot accept such imposition. \nHere, then, are the complex traits of each of the major \ngeographic regions of the Philippines. They are traits that make \nit difficult to define what a Filipino is. Taken together, they \nconstitute a cross-section of the people whose character must \nbe understood if their history is to be read correctly. Viewed \nsubjectively, their traits are as a mirror in which every Filipino \nsees himself. The image in the mirror is a modest profile. A \nmaster painter is needed to execute the portrait."

    "content": "BEFORE THE CONQUEST \nThe tradition of Philippine history writing, which the Spanish \nchroniclers originated and which American and Filipino writers \nfollowed later, had the Spaniards, more specifically Ferdinand \nMagellan, discover the Philippines. The obvious implication \nis that the Philippines, or more accurately, the archipelago later \ncalled the Philippines, was unknown to all. However, archeological \nrecords and narratives written by Chinese officials, including \nthose written by Muslim scholars, point to the early relations \nof the Philippines with neighboring countries. But these records, \nwritten or floating, are not sufficiently numerous to form a \ncontinuous and meaningful narrative of Philippine history before \nthe coming of the Spaniards. Even so, the records arc in them¬ \nselves clear proofs of the existence of a civilization which had \nan Oriental texture. \nPeopling of the Philippines.—Up to the early 1970s, it had \nbeen assumed that the Philippines was a part of mainland China. \nIt was theorized that during the Pleistocene or Ice Age, the waters \nsurrounding what is now the Philippines fell about 156 feet \nbelow the present levels. As a result, a vast area of land was \nexposed and became sort of land bridges to the mainland of \nAsia. In February, 1976, however, this theory of the “land \nbridges” to Asia was disputed by Dr. Fritjof Voss, a German \nscientist who studied the geology of the Philippines. According \nto Dr. Voss, the Philippines was never a part of the mainland \nof Asia but that it rose from the bottom of the sea and “continues \nto rise as the thin Pacific crust moves below it.” As proof that \nthe Philippines was never a part of the Asian mainland, Dr. Voss \npoints to the fact that when scientific studies were done in 1964-67 \non the thickness of the earth’s crust it was found out that the \n35-kilometer thick crust underneath China does not extend to \nthe Philippines. Hence, the latter could not have been a part or \n“land bridge” to the mainland of Asia. On the other hand, the \nPhilippines lies “along the great earth faults extending to deep \nundersea trenches” and so through violent earthquakes what \nis now the Philippines rose to the surface of the sea. \n20"

The Filipino anthropologist, F. Landa Jocano \nof the University of the Philippines, disputes Professor H. Otley \nBeyer’s assumption that the Malays migrated to the Philippines \nand now constitute the largest portion of the population. It \nwas also Beyer who theorized that the present Filipinos had a \nMalayan culture. Jocano, on the other hand, believes that fossil \nevidences of ancient men show that they came not only to the \nPhilippines but to New Guinea, Java, Borneo, and Australia, \nand that there is no way of telling whether or not they were \nNegritos. But whether they were Negritos or not is not of great \nmoment, what concerns us is that there is positive proof that man \nwas in the Philippines at least as early 21,000 or 22,000 years ago. \nThe discovery in a Tabon cave in Palawan in 1962 of a skull cap \nand a portion of a jaw, presumed to be those of a human being, \nshows conclusively that man came earlier to the Philippines than \nto the Malay Peninsula where, according to the old theory, the \nFilipinos came from. As to the present Filipinos, Indonesians, \nand Malays of Malaysia, Jocano maintains that they are the \n“end results of both the long process of evolution and the later. . . \nmovements of people. They stand co-equal as ethnic groups, with¬ \nout any one being the dominant group, racially or culturally.*** \nCulturally, it is likewise erroneous to state that Filipino culture \nis Malay in orientation. Even our historical experiences arid \nsocial organization differ from those of the people identified \nas Malays.” The differences, according to Jocano, are due to \nthe differences in their responses to their environment. On the \nother hand, the similarities found among them are due to the \nadjustment to their environment. Summarizing his findings, \nJocano maintains that * * \n1. The peoples of prehistoric Island Southeast Asia \nbelonged to the same population. * * * It grew out of \nthe combination of human evolution which occurred in \nIsland Southeast Asia about 1.9 million years ago, as \nevidenced by the fossil materials recovered from dif¬ \nferent parts of the region, and of the movements of \nother, peoples from Asia mainland during historic times. \n* F.

In 1390, Raja Baginda, one of the petty rulers of \nMenangkabaw, Sumatra, arrived in Sulu and promptly converted \nsome of the natives to Islam. His religious activities were fol¬ \nlowed by Abu Bakr who, about 1450, left Palemb&ng for Sulu. \nHe married Raja Baginda’s daughter, Paramisuli, After Ba¬ \nginda’s death, Abu Bakr exercised his powers as sultan and estab¬ \nlished a government patterned after the Sultanate of Arabia. \nIslam spread rapidly to all parts of Sulu. \ny \nIn Mindanao, Serif Kabungsuan, who had meanwhile arrived \nfrom Johore with his men, immediately began laying the founda¬ \ntions of Islam. He converted many tribes to his religion and, \nhaving married into an influential family, made himself the first \nsultan of Mindanao. From then on, Islam spread rapidly to the \nVisayas and Luzon. The arrival of the Spaniards in the second \nhalf of the 16th century and the subsequent conquest of Luzon \nled the Muslims to retreat to the south where they maintained \ntheir independence from foreign powers to the end of the Spanish \nregime. \nRelations with the Orang Dampuans.—Between 900 and \n1200 A.D., another group of immigrants came to the Philippines \nfrom southern Annam. Known as Orang Dampuans or Men \nfrom Champa, they established trading posts in Sulu, resulting \nin a flourishing trade between Sulu and Southern Annam. The \nOrang Dampuans were not politically minded and had no inten¬ \ntion of dominating the people of Sulu, who were called Bura- \nnuns. Their interest lay in trade. As usually happened, the Orang \nDampuans, because of their increasing prosperity, aroused the \njealousy of the Buranuns who, in a fit of anger, massacred some \nOrang Dampuans. The latter, who had superior weapons, took \ntheir bloody revenge on the Buranuns and, having leveled the \nenemy’s villages to the ground, sailed to their homeland. It was \nnot until the 13th century that the Orang Dampuans returned \nto Sulu to trade peacefully with the natives. \nRelations with Bapjarmasin.—The fame of Sulu reached \nas far as northern Borneo and soon Banjarmasin and Brunei, \ntwo of the important sub-states of the Empire of Sri Vijaya, \nsent traders to Sulu.

Realizing the power of a beautiful woman \nto soften the heart of a hostile ruler, the men of Banjar brought \n•their beautiful princess to Sulu. She was offered to the Buranun \nruler, who did not need a second look to decide that the princess \nwas fit to be his queen. Sulu thus came under the influence of \nBanjarmasin* and in no time the Buranuns fotmd themselves \nwilling tribute payers to Banjarmasin. With Sulu now under their \nthumb, the men of Banjar sent more adventurers and traders to \nSulu until, as time went on, the Buranuns were slowly pressured \ninto the hinterland, leaving the coasts to the wily men of Banjar. \nUnder the latter, Sulu developed into an emporium, and trading \nships from Cambodia, China, Java, and Sumatra cast anchor at \nSulu ports to savor their wealth and splendor. \nFrom the union of the Buranun chieftain and the Banjar¬ \nmasin princess came the rulers of Sulu. For many years there¬ \nafter, Sulu remained under the influence of Banjarmasin. \nRelations with China.— From scanty records that have come \ndown to the present, it is known that the Philippines had some \ncommercial relations with the neighboring countries, particularly \nwith China. Trade relations with the latter started in the 9th \ncentury when some Arab traders who were barred from the \nCentral China coast found an alternative route starting from \nMalacca and pacing through Borneo, the Philippines, and Taiwan. \nGoods from Southeast Asia and the western world were carried \nby the Arab traders to the Philippines through the southern \nroute.

So keen was \nthe competition that from 20% to 40% of the total trade with \nthe Southern Philippines was non-Chinese. Keen commercial \nrivalry lasted up to the Javanese or Madjapahit period (1377- \n1478). \nThe Chinese regained control of the Philippine trade when \nthe Ming emperor, Yung Lo, (1402-1424), came'to the throne \nof China. Yung Lo sent a large fleet consisting of more than \nsixty vessels to the Philippines under the command of Admiral \nCheng Ho. The fleet visited Lingayen in Pangasinan, Manila Bay, \nMindoro, and Sulu. These visits took place in 1405-06,1408-10, \nand 1417. For a short period, the Chinese Emperor even tried- \nto maintain a kind of sovereignty over Luzon and sent Ko-ch’a-lao \nto the island as “governor”. With the death of Yung Lo, however, \nhis pretensions to suzerainty over Luzon came to an end. \nIn the 15th century when Islam began to spread to the southern \nPhilippines, the Indo-China trade suffered a setback and the \nChinese traders, pressed back by the Muslims, sought new trading \nroutes to those parts of the Philippines where Islam had not yet \ngained a foothold. Later on, the Chinese were allowed to trade \nwith areas under the sway of Islam. \nThe Ten Bornean Datus.—The Malay settlement of Panay \nin the Visayas is told in the Maragtas, which is legendary or at \nleast semi-historical. In the 13th century, about the time that \nm \nSulu was undergoing a transformation owing to the paramount \ninfluence of Banjarmasin, Borneo was seething with discontent. \nIt appeared that Sultan Makatunaw was mistreating his subjects, \nso that ten of the chieftains (or datus) decided to leave for un¬ \nknown parts in search of freedom.

The \nfertility of the soil led Dumangsil and Balensusa to found a settle¬ \nment there, while Puti, satisfied that his men were leading peaceful \nlives, returned to Borneo. In the course of time, Dumangsil and \nBalensusa’s families spread out to the neighboring regions now \nknown as Laguna and the Bicol Peninsula.

Equally important \nwas the adoption by the Filipinos of some Chinese customs. \nThe ancient custom of arranging the marriages of children by \nthe parents was probably of Chinese origin. So is the employment \nof a go-between to negotiate marriages. Among the ancient \nVisayans, mourning was shown by wearing white shirts or dress, \na custom that is definitely Chinese. \nIndian Influences.—The Indian influences on Filipino life \nare primarily reflected in the Philippine languages, particularly \nin Tagalog. While it is not always safe to reconstruct past events \nsolely from the study of language, yet the latter offers a method \nof inferring the development of man’s thought through years of \nchanges. The large number of terms of Sanskrit origin does not \nnecessarily mean that there was direct contact between the ancient \nFilipinos and the Indians. The paucity of archeological or written \ndocuments to prove the existence of such relationship places \nin doubt the theory that there was, once upon a time, direct \ncontact between the Filipinos and the Indians. More probable \nis the theory that the Filipinos imbibed some of the elements \nof Indian culture through the Hinduized Malays who came to the \nPhilippines to settle permanently. \nDr. Trinidad H. Pardo de Tavera, in his study of Sanskrit- \nloan words in Tagalog, classifies these loan-words into “those \nwhich signify intellectual acts, moral conceptions, emotions, \nsuperstitions, names of deities, of planets, of numerals of high \nnumber, of botany, of war, of titles, some animals, instruments \nof industry, and the names of money.” The following words, \ntaken at random, represent the “borrowings” from Sanskrit, \nthe ancient language of India: \nSanskrit \nTagalog \nkshama \naksaya \nahi \nah as \nswamin \nasawa \nbhaga \nbahagi \nbhara \nbahala \nvartta \nbalita \nbhattara \nbathala \ntaruna \nkatalona \nkatha \nkatha \nkoti <10,000,000) \nkati"

    "content": "3 \nEARLY CUSTOMS AND PRACTICES \nBefore the coming of the Spaniards the Filipinos had a \ncivilization of their own. The various aspects of this civilization \ndoubtless came partly from the Malays who settled in the country \nand partly from a response to the new environment. The customs \nand traditions, the government and mode of living have, to a \ngreat extent, come down to the present and may be found in \nremote rural areas which have so far succeeded in resisting the \nimpact of modern civilization. For this reason, many of the \ncustoms and practices of the pre-colonial Filipinos are still \noperative in many parts of the country, a circumstance that is, \nin a sense, advantageous for it offers an observer first-hand \nmaterials for the reconstruction of the distant past. \nClothing.—Among the ancient Filipinos, the male attire \nwas composed of the upper and lower parts. The upper, called \nkanggan, was a black or blue collarless jacket with short sleeves. \nIt seems that the color of the jacket indicated the rank of the \nwearer, for the chief wore a red jacket, while those below his \nrank wore either blue or black depending upon their position \nin society. The lower part of the attire, called bahag, consisted \nof a strip of cloth wrapped about the waist, passing down between \nthe thighs. Such method of dressing naturally left one’s thighs \nand legs exposed. \nThe woman’s dress, too, was composed of the upper and \nlower parts. The upper, called bard or camisa, was a jacket with \nsleeves, while the lower part, called saya by the Tagalogs and \npatadyong by the Visayans, was loose skirt. A piece of red \nor white cloth, called tapis, was usually wrapped about the waist. \nMen, women and children walked about barefooted, for \nsandals and shoes were Spanish innovations. The male had a head- \ngear consisting of a piece of cloth, called putong, which was \nwrapped around his head. The color of the putong showed the \n“manliness” of a man; a red putong for instance, signified that \nthe wearer had killed a man in war. « But he who had killed at \n33"

The \nwoman, on the other hand, had no putong, but wore her hair \ngracefully knotted at the back of her head. \nOrnaments.—The early Filipinos had a weakness for personal \nadornment, for women, as well as men, burdened themselves \nwith such trappings as armlets called kalumbiga, pendants, brace¬ \nlets, gold rings, earrings, and even leglets. These ornaments \nwere made of gold, which was abundant in the mines and rivers, \nand precious stones. Since gold was a common commodity, \nthe ancients made good use of it not only by turning it into \nrings, armlets and bracelets, but also into fillings between the \nteeth. The fillings were made to adorn their teeth, not to cover \nup a decayed tooth. \nThe adornment of the body was made not only by wearing \ncostly and heavy jewels, but by tattooing it with various designs. \nEven women were so tattooed about their bodies and faces that \nthey appeared to be preparing for a masked ball in a carnival \nauditorium. The tattoo, then, was a form of ornament to en¬ \nhance the beauty of the man or woman. But it had another \nfunction, namely, to exhibit a man’s war record. The more \ntattoos a man had the more he was looked up to in society, for \nhis numerous tattoos were, in a manner of speaking, his war \nmedals. Among the ancient Filipinos, the Visayans were the \nmost tattooed people, compelling the early Spanish writers to \ncall them the Pintados or painted ones and their islands Islas \ndel Pintados or Island of the Painted People. Whether their \nsuperabundant display of tattoos was a sign of bravery or sim¬ \nple vanity is hard to say. It may be presumed, however, that the \nmost tattooed man was both vain and brave. \nHouses.—If one goes to the nearest barrio or village, one \nwill see the ancient Filipino house. This is because the average \nbarrio house is constructed along a plan that originates from \nancient times. There is basically no difference between the \npresent barrio house and the ancient Filipino one. Neither time \nnor fortune, it seems, has wrought significant changes in the \ndwelling of the rural folk. \nBuilt to suit the tropical climate, the ancient house was \nmade of wood, bamboo, and nipa palm. Antonio de Moiga, a \nSpanish jurist and chronicler, described the average house as \nhe saw it at the beginning of the 17th century:1 \n^‘Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas”, in Blair and Robertson, The Philip¬ \npine Islands (Cleveland, 1904), Vol. 16, pp. 117-118."

They are built and tiled with wood and bamboos, \nand covered and roofed with nipa-palm leaves. Each house is \nseparate, and is not built adjoining another. In the lower part \nare enclosures made by stakes and bamboos, where their fowls and \ncattle are reared, and the rice pounded and cleaned. One ascends \ninto the house by means of ladders that can be drawn up, which \nare made from two bamboos. \nAbove are their open batalanes (galleries) used for household \nduties; the parents and children live together. There is little adorn¬ \nment and finery in the house, which is called bahandin. \nAmong the descendants of the Indonesians, such as the \nIlongots and the Kalingas of northern Luzon and the Mandayas \nand the Bagobos of Mindanao, the houses were built on tree tops, \npresumably to prevent their enemies from surprising them in a \nraid. On the other hand, the Bajaos, or Sea Gypsies of Sulu, \nmade their houses in their boats, for they were a sea-roving people \nwhose life depended upon the wealth of the seas. \nSocial Classes:—Philippine society was divided into three \nclasses: the nobles, the freemen, and the dependents.3 The \nnobles, consisting of the chiefs and their families, wielded tre¬ \nmendous influence in the barangay and enjoyed rights that were \nnot usually enjoyed by the other members of society. In the \nTagalog region, they usually carried the title of Gat or Lakan, \nas in Lakan Dula or Gat Maitan. Next to the nobles were the \nfreemen, called mahadlika by the Tagalogs. They were com¬ \nposed of free men and likewise of dependents who had earned \ntheir freedom. Occupying the lowest stratum were the depend¬ \nents, known as alipin among the Tagalogs. A dependent ac- \n2The term arigues is the Hispanized form of the Tagalog haligi or post. \nSo is bahaque, which is the Tagalog bahag. \n3 It has been customary for the Spanish writers and for Filipino writers \ninfluenced by them to classify society into nobles, freemen, and slaves. \nReading carefully the accounts of Antonio de Morga and Juan de Plasencia, \none gets the impression that the so-called slaves were not actually slaves \nin the European sense, but dependents. Even today, in some places, such \ndependents exist, yet it had not been proper to call them slaves. John Leddy \nPhelan, in his book The Hispanization of the Philippines (Madison, 1959), \np. 20, correctly points out that “To call the pre-Hispanic system of labor \norganization slavery, as the Spaniards in variably did, is misleading. The \nwhole arrangement had much more in common with debt peonage and share- \ncropping than it did with the European of chattel slavery.”"

It must be noted, \nhowever, that the lines drawn between the classes were not \nhard; any member of the social classes could go up or down \nthe social ladder depending upon the attendant circumstances. \nAmong the Tagalogs, the dependents were either aliping \nnamamahay or aliping sagigilid. The namamahay had his own \nfamily and house and served his master during planting and \nharvest seasons, rowed for him, helped in the construction of \nhis house, and served his visitors. The sagigilid, on the other \nhand, had no property of his own, lived with the master, and \ncould not even marry without the latter’s consent. Among the \nVisayans, dependents were of three kinds: the tumataban, the \ntumarampuk, and the ayuey. The first worked for his master \nwhen summoned to do so; the second worked one day for his \nmaster; and the third worked three days for his lord. \nThere were gradations among the dependents. The full \ndependent was the son or daughter of dependent parents. The \nhalf-dependent was the son or daughter of parents, one of whom \nwas a full dependent and the other a freeman. The quarter- \ndependent was the son or daughter of parents, one of whom was \na half dependent and the other a freeman. \nThe Position of Women.—Women before the coming of the \nSpaniards enjoyed a unique position in society that their de¬ \nscendants during the Spanish occupation did not enjoy. Cus¬ \ntomary laws gave them the right to be the equal of men, for \nthey could own and inherit property, engage in trade and \nindustry, and succeed to the chieftainship of a barangay in the \nabsence of a male heir. Then, too, they had the exclusive right \nto give names to their children. As a sign of deep respect, the \nmen, when accompanying women, walked behind them. \n* \nMarriage Customs.—There was a custom, not so strictly \nfollowed, in which a man belonging to one class married a \nwoman of the same class. Thus, a chief married a woman of his \nrank; a noble that of his class; and the dependent that of his \nstatus. Nevertheless, this custom was not rigid, and it was \npossible for a noble to marry a dependent or a woman of the \nchieftain class, and a dependent to marry a woman outside his \nrank. A man’s wife was his legitimate wife and was called asawa, \nwhile the other women were euphemistically called “friends”."

For the custom of the \nperiod, a custom that has persisted to this day in some remote \nareas, required that he serve the girl’s parents for months and \neven years. He chopped wood, fetched water, and did chores \nrequired of him. He was not supposed to talk to his fair lady; \nonly their eyes met occasionally to exchange mute messages of \nlove. There was no chance for them to meet clandestinely, for \nthe girl was zealously guarded by the parents or by the grand¬ \nparents, who were always on the lookout for any sign of mis¬ \nchief on the part of the suitor or their girl. After having satis¬ \nfied themselves that the suitor would make a good son-in-law \nand husband, the parents finally gave their consent to the mar¬ \nriage. But first the man must meet several conditions. The \nfirst was to give a dowry, called bjgay-kaya, consisting of land, \ngold, or dependents. In the absence of these, any valuable article \nwould do. Next the poor man must also give the bride-to-be’s \nparents a certain amount of money, known as panghimuyat,4 \nas payment for the mother’s nocturnal efforts in rearing the \ngirl to womanhood. Another form of “bribe” called bigay-suso, \nwas to be given to the girl’s wet-nurse who fed the bride during \nher infancy with milk from her own breast. Not only this; the \nman must also give the girl’s parents another sum of money, \ncalled himaraw, as reimbursement for the amount spent in feeding \nthe girl during her infancy. Among the Zambals, there was \nanother “bribe” that the man must give to the girl’s relatives. \nIt was called sambon. \nThe girl’s parents arranged all these payments not directly \nwith the suitor, but with his parents. It was not an easy matter \nto make such arrangements, for it usually happened that the \nsuitor’s financial status was such that he could not comply with \nthe wishes of the girl’s parents.

This state of the courtship immediately before the \nmarriage was and is still called pamumulungan or pamamalae. \nThe marriage ceremony differed according to the status of \nthe contracting parties. Among the nobles, a go-between was \nemployed by the groom to bring the bride to him. With a lance, \nthe go-between fetched the bride from her house. Having ar¬ \nrived at the foot of-the groom’s steps, the bride pretended to \nbe coy and bashful and would refuse to ascend the stairs. The \ngroom’s father then gave her a gift to persuade her to go up into \nhis house. The bride then obligingly ascended and having enter¬ \ned the house now refused to sit down. Another gift was given \nher. She refused to eat or drink and consequently the groom’s \nfather had to shell out something for her. Groom and bride \nnow drank from one cup. At this stage, an old man announced \nthat the ceremony would begin. An old priestess then made her \nbow to the guests and, taking the hands of the couple, she joined \nthem over a plate of uncooked rice. With a shout she threw \nthe uncooked rice to the guests. The latter responded with a \nloud shout and the ceremony was over. \nMarriage among the freemen was different in that the rice \nceremony was omitted. Among the dependents, marriage was \nconsummated without benefit of clergy. It was as simple as, \n“Will you marry me?” And if the woman agreed then they were \nconsidered man and wife. \nThe marriage customs of the Muslims were similar to those \nof the inhabitants of Luzon. In the first stage of courtship, \nknown as panalanguni, or betrothal, a group of tribesmen of the \ngroom paid the girl a visit. The spokesman announced the mar¬ \nriage proposals to the girl’s parents, who immediately consulted \nwith their relatives. The decision was relayed to the village chief \nwho, in turn, informed the suitor’s parents of the decision. Once \naccepted, the second stage was set. It was called pedsungud \nor settlement of the dowry. The village chief had a hand in \nthis, for he actually handled the negotiations with the groom’s \nparents. The dowry was of seven kinds: (1) the kawasateg, \nconsisting of a rather big amount to be given to the close relatives \nof the bride; (2) the siwaka, consisting of brassware or a few \nhundred pesos to be given to those who had helped in arranging \nthe wedding; (3) the enduatuan, consisting of brassware or \nmoney or animals to be given to the village chief; (4) the \npangatulian, consisting of jewelry to be given to the girl’s mother"

This consisted of the wedding festival known as pegkawing. \nThe ceremony was held at the home of the village chief. The \ngroom was fetched by an elder from the girl’s family and car¬ \nried to the home of the village chief amidst dances and music. \nCheerers accompanied the groom. The girl was then fetched by \na member of the groom’s family and brought to the chieftain’s \nhome amidst the same cheers and dances. The bride and the \ngroom then sat facing each other. The hadji or judge read the \nso-called instruction to the couple. This finished, the groom \nwalked three times around the bride, stopping now and then \nin a desire to lift the veil from the bride’s face. This was accom¬ \npanied by the shouting and laughter of his companions, for it \nwas they who decided when the groom would lift the veil. After \na time, they finally gave the signal for the lifting of the veil, \nand the groom, taking his cue, slowly lifted his bride’s veil. The \nhadji then read the marriage ritual, and holy water was sprinkled \non the couple. The wedding ceremony was followed by six days \nof festivities. Not until the seventh night was the groom allowed \nto spend the night with his bride. \nMixed Marriages.—Tf the married couple belonged to dif¬ \nferent classes, say, a freeman and a dependent, their children \nwere equally divided among the parents in so far as social status \nwas concerned. Thus, if the father was a freeman, the eldest, \nthe third, the fifth, the seventh, and so on, whether male or female, \nbelonged to the father. The second, the fourth, the sixth, and \nso on, belonged to the mother. Since in this case the father was \na freeman and the mother a dependent, all children belonging \nto the father became freemen and those belonging to the mother \nbecame dependents. But in case there was only one child the \nlatter became half-free and half-dependent. If there were an odd \nnumber of children, say nine, the ninth child became half-free \nand half-dependent. - \nInheritance and Succession.—Among the ancient Filipinos, \nthe legitimate children automatically inherited the property of"

The property was \ndivided equally among the children, although either parent might \nshow a little partiality in giving a favorite son or daughter an \nextra jewel or a few pieces of gold. But if the father gave any of \nhis sons a dowry in order to be married to a chieftain’s daughter \nand the amount of the dowry exceeded the total amount given \nto the other sons, “the excess was not counted in the whole \nproperty to be divided”. Things given in advance to any son \nor daughter, unless expressly considered by the parents as outside \nthe property to be inherited, were interpreted to be part of the \ninheritance of the recipient. In cases where there were children \nby a free unmarried woman, aside from the legitimate children, \nthe former were considered natural children if begotten after \nthe father’s first marriage. The natural children did not share \nthe father’s property equally with the legitimate children. The \nlatter were given two parts, while the remaining part was given \nto the natural children. In the absence of legitimate children, \nthe natural children inherited all the property of the father. If \na man had legitimate children as well as children by a dependent, \nthe latter did not inherit anything, but it was the duty of the \nlegitimate to free the dependent woman and to give something \nto her children. In the absence of heirs, however, the property \nof the couple went to their nearest relatives. \nIn matters of succession, the first son of the barangay chieftain \nsucceeded his father; if the first died without leaving an heir, \nthe second son succeeded as chieftain. In the absence of any \nmale heir, the eldest daughter became chieftain. \nGovernment .—The barangay was the unit of government \nand consisted of from 30 to 100 families. The Tagalog word \nbarangay was derived from the Malay balangayy a boat, which \ntransported them to these shores. Each barangay was independent \nand was ruled by a chieftain. There was no king in those days, \nalthough some chieftains were more powerful than others and \nconsequently respected by the other chiefs. The multiplicity \nof barangays implies that there was no national or central govern¬ \nment. It was the primary duty of a chieftain to rule and govern \nhis subjects and to promote their welfare and interests. What \nhe received from them must be kept well and venerated. The \nsubjects served their chieftain during wars and voyages and helped \nhim in the tilling and sowing of the land and in the construction \nof his house. They paid tributes, called buwis, to their chieftain \nin the form of crops. The chief’s descendants and other relatives"

He was the executive, the legislator, and the \njudge. He was, naturally, the supreme commander in time of \nwar. \nThe inter-baranganic relations consisted in carrying on \ncommerce between barangays and in agreements concerning \nfriendship and alliance. A treaty of friendship and alliance was \nconcluded by means of the blood compact or sangduguan in \nwhich the contracting parties drew blood from their arms and \nmixed the blood thus drawn with the wine in a cup. The con¬ \ntracting parties then drank from the same cup, thereby making \nthem “blood-brothers”. \nWars between barangays occurred when a man from one \nbarangay went to another and was murdered without any ob¬ \nvious cause. Another cause of war was kidnapping the wives \nof men belonging to one barangay. Still another cause was the \nmaltreatment of men of one barangay by men of another ba¬ \nrangay. In these three causes of war there seemed to have been \nvery little or no attempt at all to reconcile conflicts, and the \nresolution of the conflict was brought about by force. Vengeance \nwas the motive power that drove the men of the barangays to \ncut each other’s throat. \nLaws.—Laws were either customary or written. Customary \nlaws were handed down orally from generation to generation \nand constituted the bulk of the laws of the barangay. The written \nlaws were those that the chieftain and his elders promulgated \nfrom time to time as necessity arose. Only a few of the written \nlaws, among them the so-called Code of Kalantiyaw and the \nMuslim laws, have come down to the present because many \nof them were destroyed by the early Spanish missionaries and \nmany more destroyed by the elements. \nThe laws, customary and written, dealt with various sub¬ \njects, such as inheritance, divorce, usury, partnership, crime \nand punishment, property rights, family relations, adoption, and \nloans. Criminal laws dealt with felonies, or major crimes, and \nminor crimes. A recidivist or habitual criminal was punished \nmore severely than the one who committed a first offense. Major \ncrimes were rape, incest, murder, witchcraft, insult, trespassing,"

Minor crimes, \non the other hand, consisted of such misdemeanors as adultery, \ncheating, petty theft, perjury, disturbance of the peace of the \nnight by singing, and destroying documents owned by a chief. \nThese misdemeanors were punished by exposure to the ants, \nby a small fine, by flogging, by cutting the fingers of one hand, \nor by swimming for a certain number of hours. \nThe punishments meted out to the guilty party may appear \nbarbarous to contemporary man. It must be remembered, how¬ \never, that the period was “contemporaneous” with ancient Ba¬ \nbylon, Egypt, and Greece, whose laws were as “barbarous” as, \nif not more so, than those of the ancient Filipinos. Apparently, \nthe ancients, whether Filipino or European, did not believe in \nendangering society by letting loose a gang of thieves or reci¬ \ndivists, whose manners could no longer be improved. \nHow a Law was Made.—When a chieftain of a barangay wanted \na law enacted to prevent, say, the commission of serious or minor \ncrimes, he called in the elders of the community and told them \nwhat he had in mind. The elders approved his plan, for it was \nmeant to protect society from the incursions of the bad elements. \nThe chieftain then made the necessary regulations or rules, which \nthe elders immediately approved. A public announcer, called \numalohokan, was summoned and ordered to go around the ba¬ \nrangay to announce the promulgation of the new rules and regu¬ \nlations. With a bell in one hand, the umalohokan called the \nattention of the subjects by ringing the bell furiously. The people \ngathered around him and heard from him the provisions of the \nnew law. Anybody violating the law was promptly arrested \nand brought before the chieftain to be judged according to the \nmerits of the case. \nJudicial Process.—Disputes are inevitable in any society, and \nFilipino society before the arrival of the Spaniards was not an \nexception. But disputes in the latter case were usually, though \nprobably not always, decided peacefully through a “court” \ncomposed of the chieftain as judge and the barangay elders as \n“jury”. Conflicts arising between subjects of different barangays \nwere resolved by arbitration in which a board composed of elders \nfrom neutral barangays acted as arbiter. \nTrials were held publicly and decisions were rendered \npromptly, thereby avoiding what is now known as “justice de-"

The \naccuser and the accused faced each other with their respective \nwitnesses. The latter, to show their honesty and sincerity, took \nan oath to this effect: “May the crocodile devour me if I tell \nany falsehood”, “May the lightning strike me if 1 don’t tell the \ntruth and nothing but the truth”, “May J die here and now if \nI tell a lie”, “May the sun and the moon frown upon me”. It \nwas as simple as that; there was no Bible to put one’s right hand \non, unlike today when the Bible is not taken seriously by those \nwho swear by it. \nThe disputants then began presenting their arguments, but¬ \ntressed by the testimonies of their respective witnesses. The \nchieftain listened attentively and the elders took mental notes \nof the arguments. The disputant with more witnesses to his \nside was adjudged the winner. Naturally, not a few losers con¬ \ntested the decision. In this case, the chieftain, acting as judged \nand executive, enforced his judgment by siding openly with the \nwinner and compelling the defeated party to respect the judg¬ \nment of the honorable court. Under such circumstances, the \ndefeated party had no other recourse than to bow before the \ninevitable. \nTrial by Ordeal.” The medieval European had no mono¬ \npoly of the trial by ordeal, for the ancient Filipinos practised \nit under certain circumstances to determine the guilt of a person. \nThe trial by ordeal was resorted to in order to show that God \nin His infinite wisdom always took the side of the innocent. \nSeveral ordeals were adopted to determine the innocence or \nguilt of a party. The first consisted in ordering the suspects to \nplace a stone in a vessel with boiling water and compelling them \nto dip their hands into the vessel to take out the stone. The \nsuspect who refused to obey the command was regarded as the \nculprit. If the suspects made the attempt as ordered, the man \nwhose hand was scalded the most was considered the guilty \none. The second consisted in giving lighted candles to the \nsuspects. The man whose candle unfortunately died out first \nwas regarded as the guilty party. The third consisted of order¬ \ning the suspects to plunge into the river or lake with lances. \nHe who came to the surface first was considered guilty. The \nfourth consisted in ordering the suspects to chew uncooked rice. \nEach of them spat his saliva and the one whose saliva came out"

The wrestling ordeal was called bultong; the \nvanquished in the wrestling contest was considered the guilty \nparty. Another ordeal by combat, called alaw, involved a duel; \nthe loser in this combat was adjudged guilty. In this kind of \ncombat, the loser usually lost his life, in itself considered a just \npunishment. \nReligious Beliefs .-The ancient Filipinos believed in the \nimmortality of the soul and in life after death. Their rituals \nwere based on beliefs in a ranking deity whom they called \nBathalang Maykapal and a host of other deities, in the environ¬ \nmental spirits, and in soul-spirits. The Bat hath the equivalent \nof the Spanish Dios, was supposed to be the creator of the earth \nand man and therefore superior to all other deities. These deities \nhad their functions in relation to the daily life of the believers. \nThus, they had a god of agriculture whom they called Idiyanale; \na god of death, Sidapa; a rainbow god, Balangaw; a war god, \nMandarangan, a fire god, Agni, a god of the other world, Mag¬ \nway en; a goddess of harvest, Lalahon; a god of hell, Siginarugan; \na god of love, Diyan Masalanta; and scores of other deities with \ntheir respective functions. \nDisease or illness was attributed to the temper of the en¬ \nvironmental spirits and the soul-spirits of the dead relatives. \nThe Filipinos adored the sun and the moon, animals and birds, \nfor they seemed to consider the objects of Nature as something \nto be respected. Thus they worshipped a kind of blue bird called \ntigmamanukin and another, the crow. Even the lowly croco¬ \ndile had its share of veneration and all talked to it with such \nawe and veneration that the believers went to the extent of \nimploring it not to harm them.

The basket \nis now hanging and a man, holding a Bible, says: “Jesus, Marla y Josef; \nJesus, Maria y Josef: Did Juan steal the money? Jesus, Marfa y Josef, did \nJuan steal the money?

Old trees, too, which \nwere not even fit for firewood, were believed to be “divine” \nand nobody in his right senses would dare cut down such re¬ \nlics of old age. Since the reefs, the rocks, and the crags were \nalso revered, the ancients left dishes and kitchen wares on them. \nAt other times, they shot their arrows into the cliffs jutting \ninto the sea in order to make their passage easy. Thus the \nancient Filipinos venerated almost any object that was close \nto their daily life, indicating the importance of the relationship \nbetween man and the object of Nature. \nThe veneration of the soul-spirits was universal among the \nancient Filipinos and may be termed the “Cult of the Dead”. \nThey kept alive the memory of their dead relatives by carving \nidols of stone, gold, or ivory which they called likha or larawan. \nThe memory of the recently dead relative was revered as if he \nwere alive, so that the previous relationship existing between \nthem was continued to a certain extent even after the death of \none of them. This “special” relationship was rooted in the belief \nthat the spirit of the dead would be offended if food and wine \nwere not shared with him and, having been offended, the spirit \nof the dead would take vengeance on the living by causing disease \nor illness. \nLike the modems, the ancient Filipinos adored idols called \nanito in Tagalog and diwata in Visayan. The anitos roughly \ncorrespond to the present saints. Like most Filipinos today, the \nancients offered prayers and food to their anitos; for safe nav¬ \nigation or a good catch the ancient fishermen offered food \nand prayer for the anito of the sea; for good harvest they offered \nfood to the anito of the fields; for good fortune to a new-born \nbabe they invoked the anito of the house, and so on. \nThe anitos, however, were not necessarily and exclusively \ngood. Some of them-were deemed bad and, therefore, their \nenemies. But whether good or bad, the people offered prayers \nand sacrifices to them: to the good in order to win their good¬ \nwill; and to the bad in order to placate their anger. The sacri¬ \nfices were performed by priests or priestesses called baylana \nor katalona, and consisted of food, wine, pigs, and gold. The \nsacrificial ceremony was performed in the following manner:6 \nThe priestesses dressed very gaily with garlands on their heads, \nand are resplendent with gold.

In this state she \ndeclares whether a sick person is to recover or not. All this takes \nplace to the sound of bells and kettledrums. Then she rises and, \ntaking a spear, she pierces the heart of the hog. They (the people) \ndress it and prepare a dish for the demons. Upon an altar erected \nthere, they place the dressed hog, rice, bananas, wine, and all other \narticles of food that they have brought. All this is done in behalf \nof sick persons, or to redeem those who are confined in the infernal \nregions. \nBurial.— Belief in life after death and in the relation be¬ \ntween the dead and the living made the ancient Filipinos re¬ \nspectful of their dead. The deceased relative was placed in a \nwooden coffin and buried under the house, complete with cloth, \ngold, and other valuable things. This was done in the belief \nthat a well-provisioned dead person would be received with \nalarcity in the other world, while a poorly provided dead one \nwould be received with indifference, if not with hostility. \nUpon the death of a person, the people made fires under \nhis house. Armed men acted as sentinels about his coffin, for \nit was feared that some sorcerers might take it into their heads \nto touch the coffin and thereby open it, thus releasing the \naccumulated stench of the corpse. There was much weeping \nnot only on the part of the immediate relatives, but also among \nthe friends and even neighbors. To accentuate the depth of \ntheir mourning, the relatives of the dead man or woman hired \nprofessional mourners to chant, for the benefit of all and sun¬ \ndry, the alleged good deeds and achievements of the dead. As \npersonal manifestation of mourning among the people of Luzon, \nthe relatives wore white shirts or skirts. Among the other tribes \nof Luzon and Mindanao, the relatives showed their deep mourning \nby going berserk. Sometimes they wore rattan bands around \ntheir arms, legs, and necks. Usually, the mourning relatives \nabstained from eating meat and drinking wine. \nThe ancients distinguished mourning for a woman from \nthat of a man. The former was called morotal; the latter, mag- \nlahi. Mourning for a dead chief was called laraw, which was \nobserved with more formal ceremony than that of the ordinary \nmortal.

Taboos were thereupon imposed \nand anybody who had the courage to violate any one of the \ntaboos courted disaster: he was punished by a huge fine, or by \ndeath, or by being made a lowly dependent. With the death \nof the chieftain, all wars or pretty quarrels, if there was any, \nwere ordered stopped; spears were carried with the tips point¬ \ning earthward; daggers were carried with hilts reversed; singing \nin the boats coming from the sea or river was prohibited; and the \nwearing of loud clothes tabooed. An enclosure was made around \nthe house of the dead chieftain and anybody who trespassed \non this enclosure was punished. \nThe superabundant display of lamentations ceased after \nthe funeral. However, eating and drinking continued* and the \nhigher the rank of the deceased the more eating and drinking \nthere was. The relatives of the dead fasted and limited their \nnutrition to vegetables. Among the Tagalogs this fasting was \ncalled sipa. Were the dead man a victim of foul play or had he \ndied in battle, the mourning was not ended until after any of \nthe relatives had exacted his vengeance. This act of avenging \nthe death of a relative was known as balata. Normally, the ninth \nnight after the death of a person was celebrated and was — and \nis still — known as pasiyam. The activities connected with the \npasiyam, such as staging a play in honor of the dead, were called \ntibawan, and the play so staged was called tibaw. \nDivination and Magic Charms.—The ancient Filipinos, like \ntheir contemporaries in many lands, put very much stock in \ndivination, auguries, and magic charms. They interpreted signs \nin Nature, such as the flight of birds, the barking of dogs, the \nsinging of lizards, and the like, as good or bad omens depending \nupon the circumstances. Thus, the howling of a dog in the mid¬ \ndle of the night presaged tragedy or the death of a person. \nSneezing, an ordinary human function (particularly when one \nhas a cold), was considered bad omen and those who, for in¬ \nstance, were about to go on a journey or to war were admon¬ \nished to back out, for surely misfortune would overtake them. \nOn the other hand, when a species of bird called salaksak \ncrossed the path of the warriors on their way to battle it meant \nvictory. As to the future, the ancient Filipinos also had their \nmonumental frauds in the persons of the soothsayers, called \npangatauhan, who were allegedly endowed with extraordinary \npowers to tell the fortune of anybody who cared to know be¬ \nforehand what the days ahead had in store for him."

There was, for instance, the \nasuwang, known among the Europeans as Poltergiest, who could \nchange his form from man to dog to horse to pig. There was \nthe mangkukulam who could injure any man whose face he \ndid not like by the expedient of pricking an image of a man \nin any part of the anatomy the mangkukulam wanted to hurt; \nthe manggagaway who had such power as to bring harm to any¬ \nbody he wanted to destroy; the tiyanak who took pleasure in \nsucking the blood of babies still unborn; and the tikbalang who, \nlike the asuwang, could assume different forms in order to mis¬ \nlead a traveler at night. \nSome Filipinos, however, were lucky in possessing amulets \nor charms. They were supposed to be insured against dangers. \nThe anting-anting or agimat insured a man against weapons of \nevery kind; the gayuma made a man lovable to all the ladies; \nthe odom, a charm similar to the Tagalog tagabulag, made the \nBicolano invisible; the Visayan wig a and the Tagalog sagabe \n(sa gabe) could make the possessor of this charm walk in a \nstorm or swim in a river without getting wet; and the Bicolano \ntagahupa was mixed in a drink and made the unfortunate drink¬ \ner a sort of vassal to the man with the magic potion. \nThese beliefs, religious and otherwise, were not eradicated \nwith the coming of Western civilization.

The significant change is in the tempo of life: during \nthose half-forgotten days, life was placid and characterized by \nless economic and social pressure than it is today. \nAgriculture, then as now, was the main source of liveli¬ \nhood.

The car¬ \npenters of some settlements were such good artisans that they \nwere not engaged in “any other trade than said occupation.” \nThe shipbuilders constructed all kinds of boats for travel, war, \nand commerce, boats that the Spaniards later called banco, bc- \nlangay, lapis, caracoa, virey, uinta, and prau. \nWeaving was a home industry in which women not other¬ \nwise engaged in threshing and pounding palay in wooden mor¬ \ntars, were experts.

The bulk \nof their literature was folk literature which represented a group \nheritage and reflected their daily lives. They had music and \ndances for almost all occasions and a wide variety of musical \ninstruments indicative of their ingenuity. \nLanguages.--There are more than a hundred languages and \ndialects in the Philippines, eight of which may be considered \nmajor languages. They are Tagalog (made the basis of the Na¬ \ntional Language), Iloko, Pangasinan,, Pampangan, Sugbuhanon, \nHiligaynon, Samarnon or Samar-Leyte, and Magindanao. These \nlanguages are sister-languages whose lexicon shows that they \nare descended from one parent-stock, the Austronesian or Malayo- \nPolynesian language. The differentiation into the present number \nof Philippine languages may have been the result of the necessity \nof forming new words and phrases to fit the new environment. \nThus, even today, the lexicon of the Philippine languages contains \nroots or derivations that are unquestionably Malayan.

Father Pedro Chirino, writing at the be¬ \nginning of the 17th century, said of the Filipinos: “I found in \nthis language [Tagalog] four qualities of the four greatest lan¬ \nguages of the world — Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and Spanish. It \nhas the mysticism and difficulties of the Hebrew; the distinc¬ \ntive terms of the Greek not only in the common but also in the \nproper names; the fullness and elegance of Latin; and the civil¬ \nity and courtesy of Spanish,”1 \n\\ \nThe Filipinos before the arrival of the Spaniards had a \nsyllabary which was probably of Sanskrit or Arabic provenance. \nThe syllabary consisted of seventeen symbols, or which three \nwere vowels standing for the present five vowels, and fourteen \nconsonants. The vowels are^CaJ.^Jc or t), and ^ (o or u) ; \nwhile the consonants are \n(to),'\\J (wa), andv^(y»)* \nA consonant with a diacritical mark above was pronounced \nwith either en e or an i, thus: (be or bi). If the diacritical \nmark was below, the vowel that accompanied the consonant was \neither o or u, thus: (bo or bu). The direction of writing is \nstill a problem, for no scholar could present incontrovertible \nproofs and strong reasons to support his theory. It is more \nprobable, however, that Father Pedro Chirino was correct in \nhis theory that the early Filipinos wrote vertically from top to \nbottom and from left to right. \nThe ancients wrote on the bark of trees, on leaves and bam¬ \nboo tubes, using their knives daggers, pointed sticks or iron as \npens and the colored saps of trees as ink. Only a few samples \nof their writings have come down to the present. Aside from \nthe destructive work of the elements the early Spanish mission¬ \naries, in their zeal to propagate the Catholic religion, destroyed \nmany manuscripts on the ground that they were the work of the \n1 Pedro Chirino, RelaciSn de las Islas Filipinos.

At other times, the verses were recited. \nThere are no extant examples of these songs and verses, but \nsome that have come down to the present had had Spanish in¬ \nfluences.

The latter was written in verse, and maxims and \nproverbs were employed profusely. The plays were staged in \nopen spaces, in the houses of the nobles, and in places of wor¬ \nship or sambahan. Staged to the accompaniment of music and \nthe dance, the plays dealt with love, war, legends, the memory \nof deceased relatives, and war heroes.

Thus, the Ilocano war song expresses \nthe vigor and joy of the warriors coming from battle; the dal-lot, \npopular among the peasants, was sung during a baptismal party, \na wedding, or a feast; the badeng or love song sung during a \nserenade, the dung-aw or dirge, similar to the Tagalog umbay; \nand other songs sung during planting, harvesting, and fishing. \nThe following love song, the Pamulinawen, expresses a longing \nfor a loved one with whom the serenader had cast his fate:7 \nPamulinawen, Pusok imdengamman \nToy umas-asog, agrayo ita sadiam, \nPanunotemman, dika pagintutulngan \nTo agayat, agrayo ita sadiam. \nEssem ti diak kalipatan \nTa nasudi unay a nagan \nUray sadin ti ayant disso sadino manf \nNo malagipka, pusok ti mabang-aran. \n(Pamulinawen, my Love, please hear \nMe who am sighing, longing for you; \nKindly thou think, kindly do not turn deaf \nTo me who am longing for you. \n(Forget 1 never can \nYour most sweet and beloved name; \nNo matter where [I am], if I remember you, \nMy heart leaps with joy.) \nBoth the lyrics and the music of the dung-aw show the sad¬ \nness that gripped the mother who had lost another child.

The mother, in this song, ap¬ \nparently had previously lost a child named Clara (Kalla in the \nsong), and wanted the other child, now dead, to give her best \nregards to the one in heaven. In such simple words, the song gives \none to understand the close family ties that bind the Filipino \nfamily. \nAlthough by nature lyrical, the Filipinos also wrote sustained \npoetry. They wrote folk epics which to date number no less \nthan twenty. The Ifugaos of northern Luzon had their folk \nepics Hudhud and Alim. The Hudhud glorifies Ifugao history, \nthe story centering around the hero Aliguyon. Portions of the \nHudhud were usually sung during wedding feasts and on other \nfestive Occasions. The Alim, on the other hand, deals with the \ngods and resembles the Indian epic Ramayana. The Ilocanos \nhad Biag li Ixim-ang (The Life of Lam-ang), whose origins dated \nfrom the pre-Spanish period. The Lam-ang attained, however, \nits full development durinb the Spanish period and if the Ilocano \nscholar is to be believed the epic now includes the jeep as a means \nof transportation, meaning, of course, that the Lam-ang is still \ngrowing by accretion. \nThe Muslims, another hardy people, had several darangans \nor epics, of which the Bantugan, Indarapatra and Sulayman, \nand Bidasari are the most notable. These epics have been handed \ndown orally from generation to generation and today old men \nrecite them from memory. The Indarapatra ends with the \nfollowing lines:8 \nSo great Indarapatra lived in state, \nAnd taught the simple arts \nOf farm and field. \nHe taught the huntsman’s tricks, \nIiie herdsman's lore; \nHe taught the fisherfdk \nTo call the winds. \n8Translated by Frank Lewis Minton."

Many Filipinos who play \ntwo or more musical instruments have never been in music \nacademies, nor have they any knowledge of the musical nota¬ \ntions except what they know by ear. This inborn quality they \ninherited from their ancestors of pre-Spanish days who were \nthemselves somewhat accomplished musicians. Pigafetta, the \nchronicler of the Magellan expedition, noted that the Filipinos \nof Cebu had such percussion instruments as the timbal, the \ntimbrel, the cymbal, and a kind of drum. Much later, in 1543, \nBernardo de la Torre, one of Villalobos’ officers, attended a \ndance in Samar and saw a stringed instrument known as the \nkudyapi, a kind of small guitar. The kudyapi, which the later \nTagalog adopted as the symbol of poetry, seemed to have been \na popular instrument, for it was found almost throughout the \ncountry — from the north to the south. \nAmong the Negritos of Bataan and Zambales, the favorite \nmusical instruments were the Jew’s harp made of bamboo; the \nbansic made of mountain cane with four holes; a bamboo violin \nwith abaca strings; and the gangsa, a sort of guitar. With these \nmusical instruments, the Negritos danced their favorite “Potato” \ndance in which a man was represented as stealing sweet potatoes \nin the field. Other dances were the “Torture” dance executed \nto commemorate the capture of an enemy and in which a group \nof men danced around the supposed captive; the “Duel” dance \nrepresented by a pair of warriors staging a fight with bolos, bows \nand arrows; and the “Lover’s” dance in which a man danced \naround a woman who kept her feet in time with the music. \nThe Bontok Igorots of northern Luzon had various musical \ninstruments: a Jew’s harp made of bamboo or brass; a bamboo"

The macasla was a kind of mixture \nused in fishing. The effect of the mixture upon the poor fish \nis much like that of the dynamite. The name of the dance was \ntaken from the name of the mixture. It was not only on festive \noccasions that the Tagbanuas sang and danced, but also on the \noccasion when a person was sick. The Tagbanuas beat their gongs \nand drums and danced to the sounds made in the belief that the \nmusic thus produced drove the evil spirits from the sick man’s \nbody. Upon the death of the sick man, however, his relatives \nand friends sprinkled ashes around the body, believing that the \nsoul would leave footprints on the ashes on its way out of the \nbody. This done, they danced around the corpse, singing a dirge \nin honor of the dead. \nThe Ilocanos had many songs to fit different occasions and, \nlike their brothers in the different regions, possessed many musical \ninstruments. Among these were the kutibeng, a sort of guitar \nwith five strings, the flute, and the kudyapi. One of the favorite \nIlocano dances was the kinnotan, or ants’ dance, in which a group \nof dancers gesticulated toward a person being attacked by ants \nand then made the motion of scratching the man. Another \nIlocano dance, the kinnallogong, showed a man and woman \nfacing each other, with the man remaining stationary and the \nwoman singing and dancing toward him. With a hat in one hand, \nshe attempted several times to put it on the man’s head and, \nhaving succeeded in doing so, she danced with the man. \nThe Visayans were known to be good folk dancers and \nmusicians.

The girl, \npretending coyness, at first refused to listen to the man’s plead¬ \nings, but as they danced together the woman changed her mind \nand finally accepted the man’s love offerings. \nAmong the Tagalogs, the dance and the music developed \nalmost simultaneously with the drama, for the drama could not \nbe staged without music and dancing. As «?uch, the music and \nthe dance ramified into the balatong, dalit, hiliraw, kutang- \nkutang, lulay, indulanin, kumintdng, salampati, tagulaylay, sub If, \nbarimbaw, and tagaydn. The kumintdng was a characteristic \nBatangueno dance and music which did not find much popular \nfavor outside Batangas province. But within the limits of the \nprovince, it was a favorite dance and song, so much so that up \nto 1732 the whole province was known by this dance — la pro- \nvincia de Kumintdng. \nAmong the Tinguians, the kalaleng was a favorite instru¬ \nment. It was a nope flute and used by a young man in serenading \nhis lady love. The object of the serenade in turn took out her \nmusical instrument, the diwdiw-as, a pan-pipe musical instru¬ \nment made of five or seven bamboo reeds. She responded by \nplaying on this instrument and the tunes played on both instru¬ \nments showed the status of the young man’s pleadings with the \ngirl. If the girl played a tune that showed encouragement, the \ny^ung man played a flippant tune; if not he played a melan¬ \ncholy tune. \nIt should be noted that the ancient Filipinos had music and \ndances for all occasions and that because of their frequent \nassociation their social organization was more well-knit than \nit is today. Looking backwards, one may say that during the \nSpanish empire days the Filipino social organization remained \nsubstantially as it was before the conquest, but under the im¬ \npact of American influence that same organization has suffered \na little loosening of the social ties. \nArt.—The first glimpse of the artistic sense of the primitive \ninhabitants of the Philippines can be had in the remains of their \ntools and weapons.

To this day, in some parts \nof the Philippines, but particularly in the north and in the south, \nthese embroidered garments, done in various artistic designs \nand in lively colors, are still sworn. \nThere were several influences on Filipino primitive art which \nare apparent in the surviving artifacts.

Gold and silver rings and bracelets are studded with little \nmounds of metal, surrounded with loops, sometimes a lace, of \nfine metal threads, interspersed with tiny flowers and stars. \nWhile Muslim art deals generally with plant and geometrical \ndesigns, Ifugao art deals generally with animhl and human re¬ \npresentations. Most of the Ifugao carvings are utilitarian: utensils \nsuch as the wooden bowls, spoons, forks, and smoking pipes \nare polished and embellished. The probable reason why the Ifugao \nwood carver had — and still has — a special predilection for human \nand animal representations is that he was, and is, a polytheist, \nhaving more than a thousand gods. He had an aversion to plant \nand fish forms, for his religious beliefs prohibited him from eating \nvarious vegetables and fish during the observance of certain \nceremonies. These vegetables and fish were believed offensive \nto his gods and, therefore, he avoided representations of such \nobjects. Samples of Ifugao art may be had in any curio shop \nin Manila and Baguio, but the Ifugao carvings now on sale are \ngreatly commercialized and do not really represent the profound \nfeeling of the humble artist. \n10 A.

Propelled by “Gospel, Gold and Glory,” and \nsupported by much-improved technology — new types of ships, \nsailing charts and maps, navigational instruments, gunpowder, \nand superior high-powered arms — the two Iberian superpowers \nof Spain and Portugal pushed through their ultimate goals to \ndiscover the rest of the world. With the accumulation of wealth, \npolitical authority, additional empirical knowledge in science and \ntechnology, and the support of a small economic elite, they were \nable to finance several daring reconnaissance enterprises in vast \nunknown, undiscovered seas, and untouched, uncharted con¬ \ntinents. With momentous maritime discoveries, the hitherto \nterra incognita of Asia, with her diverse ancient civilizations and \ncultures, was integrated with Europe. Thus, in the arduous and \nlengthy process of maritime discovery in the late fifteenth century, \nnew sea lanes to Southeast Asia were charted which led to the \nspice trade route. The first of these was initiated by Portugal \nby sailing via the southeastern route which made break-throughs \ninto the Indian Ocean in 1488 and ended with the fall of Malacca \n(1511) and the Maluku or the Moluccas (1512). The second was \nled by Spain by sailing via the western or southwestern route \nthat made serendipitous landfalls in the West Indies in 1492 and \nculminated in the “rediscovery” of the Philippines in 1521. \nEast Meets West.— Making the food more palatable to \nthe most discriminating medieval tastes triggered the search for \nspices of all sorts: pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and ginger \nwhich were indigenous to the East. Spices accented the bland \ntaste of meat and fish, while preserving them, in the absence \nof refrigeration. So expensive were spices like black pepper that \nit could even buy land, pay taxes, liberate a city, even pay dow¬ \nries. As Fernand Braudel commented: “Everything depended on it, \neven the dreams of the fifteenth century explorer.” In the eleventh \ncentury, pepper was even meticulously counted out by pepper¬ \ncorns, and when dried, cinnamon and ginger were weighed with \n69"

Merchants suddenly became important in the eyes of the \npeople, and they not only became richer but also powerful in the \nmore famous trading cities of Italy. Gold and silver not only \nfunded but also expanded the jewelry trade of rare pearls and \nrubies from far-away India. \nThe inclusion of Asian trade to that of Europe led not only \nto the flow of economic products and the wealth of Asia to \nEuropean societies but also to the dynamic interaction of cultures. \nThe tremendous profits European trade brought to nation states, \nparticularly Portugal and Spain, intensified European rivalries for \nthe fabled source of Oriental products. This required the inter¬ \nvention of the only known power in European relations — the \nPope. \nThe Lusitanian-Hispanic Rivalry in Maritime Discoveries.— \nPortugal was the first country to use innovation in seamanship \nand boatbuilding with the establishment by Henry “the Navigator” \nof the first navigational school in the globe at Sagres Point in \n1419. Between 1451 and 1470, the Portuguese discovered and \ncolonized all the islands of the Azores in the Atlantic which they \nused to stage the discovery of the Americas and the circumnav¬ \nigation of the west coast of Africa. \nPropelled by their undying zeal, the Portuguese pursued \nthe dream of reaching the East using a direct all-water route. \nBy the turn of the fifteenth century, two of her intrepid explorers \nhad reached the southernmost end of Africa, and later, to India, \nthus winning the race to the wealth and spices of the East. \nSpain, however, had earlier dispatched the first truly moment¬ \nous exploration in modem times. Inspired by the Florentine map- \nmaker Paolo Toscanelli to discover westward sea route to India, \nChristopher Columbus (Cristoforo Colombo) instead made a land¬ \nfall in Guanahani (earlier identified as San Salvador but in 1986 as \nSamana Cay) Island in October 1492, and two weeks later, on the \ncoast of Cuba. His voyage, however generated misapprehension \nand dispute between Spain and Portugal. King John (Joao) of \nPortugal protested on the ground that it was an incursion by \nSpain of his sphere of influence. Pope Alexander VI mediated \nbetween the two powers.

The perceptive Portu¬ \nguese, however, realizing the Spanish pope’s bias, did not readily \nagree tcf the established demarcation line. Instead, they worked \nfor its revision to reduce the area of the territory granted to the \nSpanish explorers in the New World. \nThe spheres of influence of the two superpowers of the \nfifteenth century thus, were finally fixed by an imaginary line \ndrawn from the north and south poles, a hundred leagues (one \nSpanish legua = 5.57 kilometers) from Spain, west of the Cape \nVerde Islands (on the coast of present Senegal, in the western¬ \nmost tip of Africa). The lands lying to the east of the line were \nreserved for Portugal, and those territories to the west to Spain. \nBoth nations agreed to propagate the tenets of Christianity in \ntheir newly-found lands. \nIn 1494, the treaty of Tordesillas was signed which partitioned \nthe non-Christian world into two spheres of influence. It faith¬ \nfully followed the papal bull of 1493 granting the New World \nto Spain, while Africa and India were reserved only for Portugal. \nHowever, the treaty shifted the demarcation line 370 leagues \nfarther west, thus assigning Brazil to Portugal.

His original suggestion of reaching \nthe Maluku (the Spice Islands) by sailing westward was rejected \nby his King. After seven years of active' service in the East, he \nreturned to his home country and then fought-in the North \nAfrican campaign against the Moors. It was Ruy Faleiro, a bril¬ \nliant cosmographer, who egged him to serve Spain as he was then \nnot in the good graces of Lisbon court. In 1518 he convinced \nCharles V that he could find a shorter way to the Maluku by \nsailing westward via the Americas. As part of a reconnaissance \nvoyage in 1511-12, Magellan had visited the Spice Islands. Magellan \nreceived royal instruction to sail directly to the Maluku and \nto bring back a cargo of the priceless spices. Thus began “the \ngreatest of all epics of human discovery” when he sailed from \nSan Lucar, Spain, in 1519, on board five very antiquated ships"

In Mactan, \nhe was defeated and killed in battle in April 1521 as a conse¬ \nquence of his intervention in a dispute between Lapulapu and \nZula, chieftains of Mactan. Only one ship, in fact the smallest \nof them, the Victoria, completed the voyage back to Spain in \n1522, arriving in Seville, led by Juan Sebastian del Cano. A mere \neighteen Europeans and four Malays survived, thus leaving 170 \nof “the original expedition lost on the way.” Other survivors \nwere retrieved later by subsequent expeditions. \nThe expedition was a test of human endurance. Food was \nthe most serious and perennial problem, as by the time they \nwere in the immense Pacific, Magellan’s men were compelled \nto eat worm-infested powdery biscuits soiled by rats, sawdust, \nand sea-soaked leather. Lack of Vitamin C resulted in rampant \ndeaths among the crew members due to scurvy. \nMagellan did not live to see the final completion of the “first- \nknown voyage in history to circumnavigate the globe.” It was \nthrough this trip that the Europeans first learned of the existence \nof the Philippines.

The Spaniards vividly reported that “Maluarbuco” \nin northeastern Mindanao was rich in gold, chickens, wild pigs \nand coconuts; the women were described as beautiful and the \nmen fair-complexioned.

In April of \nthe same year. Villa de San Miguel, later changed to Ciudad del \nSantisimo Nombre de Jesus, after the discovered Santo Nino of \nCebu, became “the first Spanish town established in the Archi¬ \npelago” and the pioneer permanent settlement in the Philippines. \nLegazpi was specifically instructed to bring back to Mexico \nsamples of Philippine-grown spices; to discover the return route to \nMexico; and to abide by the 1529 Zaragoza treaty not to proceed \nto Maluku. Indeed,/the spiralling of the price of spices in Spain \nhad been considered by some writers as one of the significant \nfactors that pushed the Legazpi voyage. Fr. Andres de Urdaneta, \nLegazpi’s chief pilot, whose expertise of the seasonal winds he \nhad acquired while with the Loaisa expedition, discovered the \n“Urdaneta Passage” on his return to Navidad via the Pacific. \nThis unique sea lane was subsequently used by the Manila-Aca- \npulco galleons until the nineteenth century.

There existed on \nthe eve of the coming of the Spaniards fragmented units of islands \nand islets of various sizes separated by numberless bodies of water, \nas well as multiple ethnolinguistic groups, mostly animistic, and \nin the south, Islamized.

Thus, with the \npermanent colonization by Legazpi, the indios lost the freedom \nthey earlier enjoyed. \nPolitical Institutions.--The hierarchical political set-up of the \nPhilippines during the Spanish regime may be seen in the political \ninstitutions established by the colonial power. From 1565 to \n1821, the Philippines was a captaincy-general administered by \nthe Spanish king through the viceroyalty of Nueva Espana \n(Mexico). All Spanish possessions were governed by the Real \ny Supremo Consejo de las Indias (Royal and Supreme Council \nof the Indies) eastablished in 1524 by Charles V. It was, next \nto the King, the paramount lawmaker and administrator over¬ \nseeing the colonies of the Spanish empire, guided basically by a \ncompendium of laws first compiled in 1681 called the Recopila- \ncion de leyes de los reynos de las Indias. The Ministerio de Ultra¬ \nmar (Ministry of Colonies), by May 1863, had supplanted the \nConsejo de las Indias. \nBureaucracy m the colonial Philippines may be divided into \ndifferent levels of administration, from the central or national, \nprovincial, city, municipal, and barrio levels. On the national \nlevel with its seat of power in Manila, (Intramuros), the King, \nthrough the Consejo de las Indias, governed through his sole \nspokesman and representative in the Philippines, the gobernador \ny capitan-general. As Captain-General of the colony, the gober- \nnador-general was commander-in-chief of the army and the navy. \nHe was also president of the Real Audiencia (Supreme Court), \nthe island’s highest judicial body, and as vice-real patron, he had \nthe power over ecclesiastical appointments in the church and \neven the right to supervise mission work. The governor-general \nwas the source of civil power for the various levels of adminis¬ \ntration. His salary amounted to P40,000 per annum, but some \nunscrupulous and enterprising among them, augmented it by \nreceiving bribes and 4‘gifts”.

Thus, not only was \nhe the executive and judicial authority but he was also the military \nauthority in his area of responsibility, answerable solely to the \nGovernor General and the Real Audiencia in Manila. \nThe annual salary of an alcalde mayor before 1844 ranged \nfrom P300 to P2,000, and after 1847, from PI,600 to PI,500, \naccording to class. However, with the indulto de comercio, he \nearned considerably more, for as comerciante, the Filipinos were \nforced to do business with him (they bought from his store), and he \nengaged in usurious money-lending practices. In 1840, it was re¬ \nported that some of the alcaldes may ores' positions were valued \nat P50,000 per annum. All the complaints of the Filipinos against \nthe abuses of the alcaldes may ores were somewhat relaxed by the \nReform Decree of 1886 when the civil governor became the \nexecutive provincial official and the alcalde was reduced to a \nmunicipal judge, thus transforming the provincial governor from \na “merchant-governor” to a “judge-governor”. \nBy the end of the seventeenth century, there were only six \ncities or villas established in Luzon and the Visayas: Manila, \nVilla Femandina (Vigan), Nueva Segovia (Lal-lo, Cagayan), Nueva \nCaceres (Naga), Cebu, and Arevalo (also called Villa, Iloilo). \nCities were governed by the ayuntamiento or city government \nformed in 1889.

The residencia, dating back to \nthe fifteenth century in Spain, was first resorted to in the Indies \n(Spanish possessions in Amerasia including the Philippines) in \n.1501. It'was the judicial review of a residenciado (one judged) \nconducted at the end of his term of office, supervised publicly \nby a juez de residencia. Imposed on a residenciado found guilty - \nof public misconduct were either heavy fines, sequestration of \nproperties, or imprisonment, or, a combination of all three penal¬ \nties.

Visitas may be specific or general. A specific visita meant \nan investigation of a single official or a province; a general visita \nmeant an investigation of the whole viceroyalty like Mexico or \ncaptaincy-general like the Philippines. First applied in the Indies in \n1499, the visita had the same objectives as the residencia, that is, to \nensure faithful and efficient service on the part of government \nauthorities.

Any Fili¬ \npino or Chinese mestizo, 25 years old, literate in oral or written \nSpanish, and who had been a cabeza de barangay (barrio adminis¬ \ntrator) for four years, could be a gobernadorcillo. This was the \nhighest government position a Filipino could attain during the \nSpanish regime, and together with the parish priest, his role was \nconsidered highly significant in a town. Among his multifarious \nadministrative duties was preparation of the padron (tribute \nlist), recruitment and distribution of men for the draft labor, \ncommunal public work (as in the construction and repair of minor \nbridges) and the quinto (military conscription), postal clerk, \njudge in civil suits involving P44.00 or less. Indeed, he intervened \nin all administrative cases pertaining to his town: lands, justice, \nfinance, and the armed forces. For all these, his yearly salary \nwas P24.00. The gobernadorcillo was assisted by three super¬ \nnumeraries or inspectors (tenientes de justicia) who supervised \nmatters such as boundaries of cultivated fields (sementeras)."

Nowhere was the greatest influence and complete \ncontrol of the clergy felt than in the lowest Filipino bureaucratic \nlevel — the municipio or pueblo. The parish priest was more often \nthan not the only Caucasian and the most important official domi¬ \nnating the town during the entire span of the colonial period. “The \nfriars were not only the parish priests, or spiritual guides,” as one \nFilipino put it, “but in effect were rulers of the municipalities; \nin fact, the whole government of the islands rested on them. \nConsequently, every abuse of the many which led to the revo¬ \nlution of 1896-1898 was charged to them by the people.” This \nkeen observation wa& further corroborated by Del Pilar, when he \nsaid: \n. . . The friars control all the fundamental forces of society in the \nPhilippines. They control the educational system, for they own the \nUniversity of Santo Tomas, and are the local inspectors of every \n-4 \nprimary school. They control the minds of the people because, \nin a dominantly Catholic country, the parish rectors can utilize \nthe pulpit and confessionals to pubiicly or secretly influence the \npeople; they control all the municipal and local authorities and the \nmedium of communication; and they execute all the orders of the \ncentral government... \nIn the national level, the influence was exercised through \nthe vast networks of parishes. By the end of the Spanish regime, \nthere were 967 regulars (priests who belonged to a religious order) \nmanning dioceses in the Philippines, whereas only 675 seculars \n(priests who did not belong to any religious order) administered \nparishes in 1896-98. \nProbably the most persistent complaint leveled by the Fili¬ \npinos against the church was its economic role as landowners, \nin particular the Dominicans, Augustinians, and the Recollects. \nIt was, therefore, not surprising that the Philippine Revolution \ncentered in the areas where the vast haciendas (friar estates) \nthrived: Cavite, Laguna, Bulacan, Morong and Manila province. \nFor example, one-fourth of the total area of friar estates in the \nPhilippines was located in Cavite, and 48% of the total arable \nlands in the Tagalog belonged to the friars. \n$$*$*$*"

All the \nnew Christian converts were required to construct their houses \naround the church and the unbaptized were invited to do the same. \nThis was approved without hesitation by no less than the then \nGovernor General of the Philippines himself. The reduction plan \npresented by Franciscan Fr. Juan de Plasencia to the Synod of \nManila (1582) was approved unanimously by missionaries of all \nthe religious orders. \nWith the reduction, the Spaniards attempted to tame the \nreluctant Filipinos through Christian indoctrination in a quite \nnovel settlement pattern using the convento/casa real/plaza \ncomplex as the focal point. The reduction, to the Spaniards, \nwas, no doubt, a “civilizing” device to make the Filipinos law- \nabiding citizens of the Spanish crown, and, in the long run, to \nmake them ultimately “little brown Spaniards,” adopting Hispanic \nculture and civilization. The more courageous unbelievers among \nthem who rejected Spanish domination, went to the hills and \nbecame remontados, cimarrones, ladrones monteses, malhechores \nor tulisanes in the eyes.of the Spaniards. As part of the strategy of \nenticing the unwilling unbaptized indios, the Spanish friars utilized \n80"

Other attractions included medals, scapularies, cords and \nrosaries. All these “hypnotized” the spirit of the indios. Upon \nbaptism, Filipinos were given Christian names usually derived \nfrom the feast day of the saint when he was born or baptized, \nwhich facilitated identification and recording of population for \ntax collecting purposes. \nWith the reduction, the precolonial barangays metamor¬ \nphosed externally and internally. External changes included \nthe construction of colonial churches and convents made of \nstone, some of them appearing like solid fortresses to impress the \nindios, as well as the building of private homes of cal y canto \n(lime and mortar) protected either by roofs of tiles or galvanized \niron sheets and provided with a wide azotea and water reservoirs \n(aljibes). Changes from without were the consequences of Spanish \ntrade which brought in new cultural elements from the Americans \nand the Pacific, alongside with a countless inventory of new \nAztec (Mexican) ethnobotanic specimens as com, camote, cassava, \ntobacco and numerous exotic fruits, vegetables, and medicinal \nherbs. The integration of Spanish customs and values, Christian¬ \nity, and the Castilian language which blended with the local \nculture, constituted the internal changes. \nI. ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS: \nA. “Taxation Without Representation”.— Income-generating \nmechanisms were introduced by the Spanish colonial government \nin the Philippines consisting of direct (personal tribute and income \ntax) and indirect (customs duties and the bandala) taxes, mono¬ \npolies (rentas estancadas) of special crops and items as spirituous \nliquors (1712-1864), betel nut (1764), tobacco (1782-1882), \nexplosives (1805-1864), and opium (1847). \nThe buwis (tribute) may be paid in cash or kind, partly or \nwholly, as palay or tobacco, chickens, textiles, or even wax and \nspecial regional produce, depending on the area of the country. \nIn the 1570s, the tribute was fixed at eight reales (1 real = 12M \ncentavos) or in kind or “gold, blankets, cotton, rice, bells” and"

Until \nthe mid-nineteenth century, the Filipinos were required to pay \nthe following taxes and other impositions: tribute of ten reales; \ndiezmos prediales (tithes) of one real; town community chest, \none real; and sanctorum tax for church support, three reales, \ntotalling fifteen reales. \nAside from the tribute, a special tax of V2 real or rice was \ncollected called samboangan or donativo de Zamboanga to crush \nthe Moro raids (collected since 1635 until the mid-19th century) \nand uinta (gathered since 1781 till 1851, with some interruptions) \nto equip vintas to shield the coastal areas of Bulacan and Pam- \npanga. The vinta's counterpart was the falua, collected in Cama- \nrines Sur, Cebu, Misamis and other littoral provinces. \nSpecial privileges of tax exemptions were granted to the \ndescendants of the Filipino chiefly class who served in the paci¬ \nfication campaigns conducted by the conquistadores, notably \nCarlos Lakandula of Manila, Pedro Mojica of Cavite, and Rajah \nTupas of Cebu. Equally exempted were the laborers of the \narsenal and artillery yard of Cavite, the mediquillos (Filipinos \nwho had medical experience but no title), vaccinators and college \nand university students of Santo Tomas, San Jose, San Juan de \nLetran and San Carlos (Cebu). \nAnother tax collected was the bandala., Coming from the \nTagalog word maridala (a round stack of rice stalks to be threshed), \nbandala assumed the meaning of the annual enforced sale or \nrequisitioning of goods, particularly of rice or coconut oil, in \nthe case of Tayabas. Pampanga and the Tagalog regions, then \nthe rice bowl of the Philippines, bore the greatest brunt of what \namounted to outright confiscation since payment was only. in \npromissory notes. The Spaniards* debt to the Kapampangans, \nfor instance, reached some P70,000 between 1610 and 1616, \nspiralling up to P200,000 in 1660, thus sparking a revolt in \n1660-61. Pampanga provided an annual bandala of 24,000 fanegas \nof rice (a fanega is about 2V2 bushels) or approximately more than \nP6,000 during Governor Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera’s time \n(1635-1644), causing the Kapampangan’s refusal to plant rice. \nThe bandala was abolished in the provinces of Tondo, Bulacan, \nPampanga, Laguna, Batangas, Tayabas and Cavite in November \n1782. \nBy 1884, the tribute was replaced by the cedula personal \nor personal identity paper, equivalent to the present residence tax."

Polo y Servicio Personal or Prestacion Personal.\" -Polo \nactually is a corruption of the Tagalog pulong, originally meaning \n“meeting of persons and things” or “community labor.” Drafted \nlaborers (polistas) were either Filipino or Chinese male mestizos \nranging from 16 to 60 years old, who were obligated to give \npersonal service to community projects, like construction and \nrepair of infrastructure, church construction, or cutting logs in \nforests, for forty days until 1884, when labor was reduced to k \nfifteen days. However, one could be exempted by paying the \nfalla (corruption of the Spanish falta, “absence,” corrupted into \nthe contemporary paly a, “absence from work,”) which the polista \npaid daily at IV2 real during the 40-day period he was expected \nto work. The polo system was patterned after the Mexican \nrepartimiento or selection for forced labor. \nSome of the negative effects of the polo on the Filipino \nincluded the upsetting of the village economy because labor \ndrafts usually coincided with the planting and harvesting seasons; \nforced separation from the family and relocation to different \nplaces, sometimes outside the Philippines; and decimation of \nthe male population as they were compelled at times, to escape \nto the mountains instead of working in the labor pool. According \nto De la Costa: \n. . . Large numbers of able-bodied men were frequently withdrawn \nfor long periods from their families and ordinary occupations, \norganized into labor corps under the supervision of overseers, and \nsent to fell logs in the forests, haul them to the shipyards, and work \nin the construction of the ships themselves. This labor draft fell \nmost heavily on the Pampango and Tagalog provinces of central \nLuzon, because of the shipyards located at Cavite. \nC. Encomiendas: Royal and Private.~~The encomienda, \nfrom the word encomendar, meaning ‘ to entrust,” was another \nrevenue-getting Hispanic institution introduced to the Philippines \nvia Mexico. Strictly speaking, it was a grant from the Spanish \ncrown to a meritorious Spaniard to exercise control over a specific \nplace including its inhabitants. It was not a land grant as most \nearlier scholars believed. The encomendero was duty-bound to \ndefend his encomienda from external incursions, to keep peace \nand order, and to assist the missionaries in teaching the Christian"

In return, \nthe encomendero was granted the right of imposing tribute accord¬ \ning to the limit and kind set by higher authorities. For instance, \nSilang, in upland Cavite, was an encomienda of Captain Diego \nJorge de Villalobos of Lisbon and his wife, Magdalena de Illescas. \nHe settled personal feuds within his encomienda even as he assist¬ \ned the restitution of fire victims and the erection of a new church \nand convent for his community. Villalobos contributed P100 \nin cash and 180 fanegas of rice for parish assistance when he \nbecame encomendero. \nTwo kinds of encomiendas existed in the Philippines: the royal \nor crown (realenga or encomienda de la real corona) and the private \n(encomienda de particulares). The former were lands reserved for \nthe crown and included the principal towns and ports, like Bagum- \nbayan (now Luneta), Lagyo (approximately the site of the present \nPlaza militar, between Malate and Ermita), Santa Ana de Sapa, \nTondo, Navotas and Malabon in Manila; and Lubao and Betis in \nPampanga. The private encomiendas were granted to individuals \nwho were either the King’s proteges or men who served with merit \nduring the conquest and pacification campaigns. Examples of these \nwere Pandacan, Sampaloc and Macabebe, privately owned by one \nPedro de Chaves; Bataan by Juan Esguerra; and Batangas owned \npersonally by Francisco Rodriguez. At least two distinguished Fili¬ \npinos from Pampanga were owners of private encomiendas Francis¬ \nco Liwag with 55 tributes (1645-50) and Juan de Macapagal with \n300 tributes (1665). \nWhen first implemented in the Visayas, Legazpi authorized \nthe encomendero to collect tribute of eight reales yearly in cash \nor in kind from all 19 to 60-year old Filipino males of private \nencomiendas. At least one-fourth of the total collection went \nto the encomendero, another portion to the priests, and the \nremaining to the government. However, some encomenderos \nviolated regulations by raising the rate of tribute paid in money \nor in kind by the poor Filipinos. With profit motive in mind, \nencomenderos arbitrarily increased the value and appraisal of \nproducts at different periods. The unscrupulous among them \nmade tremendous gains in temporarily hoarding staple items like \nrice and clothing materials and selling them at higher rates later. \nTo evade penalties and corporal inflictions, Filipinos who could \nnot afford either the monetary or species payment fled to the \nhills. Those who escaped from the oppressive taxation were \nregarded by Spaniards as “lawless” remontados or tulisanes \n(bandits)."

Each encomendero collected according to his \npersonal whim. When gold was abundant and money was scarce, \nthey demanded cash or reales; when the reales were plentiful and \nthere was scarcity of gold, they asked for gold, even when the \npoor Filipinos were coerced to buy them. During bumper harvests, \nthey demanded products like rice, tobacco or even all of the \nFilipino possessions, and they were forced “to travel great di¬ \nstances’* to try to buy them at high rates. Sometimes, the Fili¬ \npinos bought back at very exorbitant prices the same items (rice, \nespecially during lean harvest) they sold for a very low price. \nEncomenderos sometimes seized “the entire quantity of his \nrice” from the Filipino “without leaving him a grain to eat.” \nMany Filipinos died of starvation, especially during famines and \ndrought due to the scarcity of rice and they were forced to eat \ncoconut and banana shoots. If the Filipinos resisted they were \npublicly flogged, tortured or jailed. These unjust collections of \ntributes was one of the causes of intermittent uprisings in the \nPhilippines. \nD. The Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade (1565-1815). — \nRunning the only regular fleet service in the huge stretch of the \nPacific Ocean for two hundred fifty years was the Acapulco \ngalleon (known as galleon de Manila or nao de China) with two \nvessels making the journey yearly — one outgoing, the other \nincoming ■— between Manila and Acapulco de Ju£rez, reaching \nas far as Callao in Peru. The trip lasted approximately two hun¬ \ndred days, the return voyage alone taking seventy days. Through \nthe Manila galleons, the Amerasian worlds were linked by untold \nluxuries and wealth: spices and silk for the Americans and the \nMexican and Peruvian dos mundos (pillar dollars or “pieces of \neight”) for the Asians. \nThe galleon trade benefitted only a very small coterie of \nprivileged Spaniards — the Spanish governor, members of the \nconsulado (merchants with consular duties and rights) usually \ninsulares, and Spanish residents in Manila. The few Spaniards \nwho relied heavily on the trade became affluent, but when the \ntrade declined in the eighteenth century, an economic depression \nresulted which arrested the normal population growth. \nTempted by the lucrative trade Chinese immigrants converged \nat the Parian or Alcaiceria of Manila in Binondo as early as 1637. \nBy 1687, a community of Christian Chinese and mestizos was"

Retail and small credit busi¬ \nness came under the control of Chinese mestizos. \nThe damaging effects, e.g., the neglect of native extractive \nindustries like agriculture and arrest of population growth of \nthe Manila-Acapulco trade, far outbalanced the advantages. The \nonly active Filipino involvement was in the construction of \ngalleons — in the cutting of massive and heavy Philippine hard- \nwoodsr, hauling and transporting them usually to the far-off \nshipyards of Cavite, Mindoro, Marinduque or Masbate. Toponyms \nin Mindoro remind us of the travails of Filipino forced labor: \nNaujan, where the naos (galleons) were built; Calapan, where the \noverburdened Filipino carpenters cut the huge and heavy logs \ninto prepared wooden planks; and of course, Puerto Galera, \nwhere the completed galleys were safely moored. Filipinos were \nforcibly ordered by the alcaldes may ores to plant cdeonuts and \nabaca under the guise of “support of the Indians.” Failure to \ncomply with the needed supplies of coconut oil and abaca fibers \nwere heavily fined. Coconuts furnished the oil, wine, and coir \nfor rigging and caulking for the galleons and other sea vessels. \nAbaca was transformed into rigging materials in Cavite. Ropes \nwere also made from sugar (kaong) and sago (cabo negro) palm \nfibers, and iron-headed ship pikes from hardwoods. Sails were \nfashioned out of the Iloko-woven cotton blankets exacted as \ntribute payment. \nIn theory, galleon construction was not meant to conflict \nwith the planting and harvesting schedules but in practice this \nwas not the case. Thus, the growth of Philippine agriculture \nwas further retarded, so that as early as the 1600s, many of the \nsignificant Filipino cottage industries such as weaving and ex¬ \ntractive industries were being ruined and disregarded along with \nagriculture, as money and gains were channelled to the galleon \ntrade. Forced labor ignited the Sumodoy revolt (1649) when \nthe Visayans were drafted to haul timber to Cavite, and the \nPampanga Revolt (1660), when the overburdened and Overtaxed \nKapampangans were inflamed by the forcible cutting and hauling \nof heavy logs. \nHowever, among the positive results of the galleon trade \nwere the intercultural exchanges between the Philippines and \nthe Americans, symbolized by no less than the Mexican-made \nVirgin of Antipolo, chosen as the patroness of the sailors, who \nprotected them from untold perils across the Pacific.

In exchange, \nthe return voyage brought innuhierable and valuable flora and \nfauna into the Philippines: avocado, guava, papaya, pineapple, \nhorses and cattle. The moro-moro, moriones, and the image of \nthe Black Nazarene of Quiapo, were also of Mexican origins. \nA considerable number of Nahuatl (Aztec) elements crept into \nthe Philippine languages, such as tiyangge (tianquiztli), kakaw \n(cacahuatl), tsokolate (xoco-atl), tamales (tamalli), kamatsili \n(quauhmochitl), sayote (chayotli), singkamas (xicama) and tocayo \n(tocaitl). The Mexicans, on the other hand, borrowed the Fili \npino words tuba (coconut toddy), hilanhilan (ilang-ilang), and \nParian. \nE. Royal Economic Society of Friends of the Country \n(1780-ca. 1895).*“A mere frigate captain before he assumed \ngovernorship, Jose de Based y Vargas represented the true ex¬ \nample of Spain’s despotismo ilustrado, who for nine years re¬ \nvamped the then existing antiquated economic system which \nstagnated progress in the Philippines. Following the royal order \n“to form a society of learned and competent persons capable \nof producing useful ideas,” he formally organized, in 1780, the \nReal Sociedad EconSmica de Amigos del Pats composed of lead¬ \ning men in business, industry and the professions, whom he \nhimself prodded to exploit the Island’s natural bounties. -The \nSociety antedated the Royal Philippine Company. Both economic \nagencies acted as effective media and instruments of Spanish \ncolonization. \nCompelled to make the colony truly self-supporting in \neconomy and entirely self-sufficient from the annual Mexican \nsubsidy, Basco introduced the Plan General Econo mico which \nincluded the income-generating monopolies of tobacco, areca \nnut, spirituous liquors and explosives, which, unfortunately, \nbrought untold hardships on the Filipinos. Extolling the ben¬ \neficial effects of exploiting the island’s natural resources through \nagriculture, commerce and industry, this “enlightened despot” \ngave incentives by awarding cash prizes and medals of recognition \nfor excellence in farming indigo, spices, cotton, cultivating mul¬ \nberry for silk production, bee-keeping, mining, inventions, the \narts and sciences.

It was equally responsible \nfor introducing and acclimatizing the mynah birds (martinez) \nfrom China to fight against migratory locust infestation in the \nPhilippines. The society was also credited with introducing \nthe carabao ban in 1782 (to conserve this draft animal), the \nformation of silversmiths and gold beaters' guild in 1783, and \nthe construction of the first papermill in the Philippines in 1825. \nThe Royal Economic Society of Friends of the Country died \ntemporarily in 1787, was revived in 1819, and was suspended \nbriefly in 1820 due to the Asiatic cholera epidemic. It resumed \nits activities in 1822, gradually faded out in 1875, revived again \nin 1882, until it ceased to exist by the middle of the 1890s. \nF. Royal Philippine Company (1785-1814).—On March 10, \n1785, Charles III created the Royal Philippine Company with \na 25-year charter for the main purpose of uniting American \nand Asian commerce. It was granted exclusive monopoly of \nbringing to Manila, not only Philippine but also Chinese and \nIndian goods, and shipping them directly to Spain via the Cape \nof Good Hope. Modelled after the Royal Guipuzcoana de Cara¬ \ncas Company in South America, it was vehemently opposed by \nDutch and English interests who saw it as a direct attack on \ntheir trade in Asian goods. It also met stiff opposition from \nthe Spanish-Manila traders of the Consulado y Comercio de Ma¬ \nnila who saw it as a strong competitor of the Manila-Acapulco \ntrade. A royal decree assigning 3,000 shares of stocks (out of the \n32,000) for the Manila merchants and religious corporations \npartially mollified the galleon traders even as some refused the \nsubscription. \nThis keen rivalry resulted in political unrest in the Philippines \nand tremendous losses suffered by the Manila board of mer¬ \nchants, in addition to losses suffered from disastrous shipwrecks \nand piracy. The Manila-Acapulco trade deteriorated as the Royal \nPhilippine Company reaped profits. After a decade of existence, \nit netted a gain of more than ten million pesos in 1794-95 out of \nits initial capital stock of eight million, and in the following year, \nmore than fifteen million pesos. Forty percent of its net profits \nwere set aside for research, technical assistance, and community \ndevelopment in the Philippines.

To the Filipinos, the effect was more untold \nmisery, as they were forced to plant much-prized cash exports \ncrops from which they did not have any direct benefit at all. \nThe Royal Philippine Company devoted exclusive preference \nto cotton production and weaving, cultivation of black pepper, \nbesides the propagation of silk, indigo and sugar. Cotton cloth \nweaving was an ancient Filipino cottage industry and cotton was a \nfavorite trade item that attracted the Chinese in Legazpi’s time. \nBlankets and other textiles also served as gold and other in¬ \ndigenous produce were used for tribute payment. \nG. Infrastructure, Telecommunications and Public Utilities \nDevelopment.-Modem ways of telecommunications developed \nin the nineteenth century. The Ferrocarril de Manila extended \n120 miles long up to Dagupan (Pangasinan) and it was the only \nrailway line in the Archipelago, constructed using mainly Fili¬ \npino labor and operated regularly four years before the out¬ \nbreak of the Philippine Revolution in 1896. \nThe Compahia de los Tranvias de Filipinas was established \nin Manila in 1885 by Jacobo Zobel de Zangroniz and Adolfo \nBayo. By 1892 there were five street car service lines connecting \nthe primate city with the suburbs: four horse-drawn in Intra- \nmuros, Malate, Sampaloc and Tondo, and one tranvia de vapor \n(steam-powered) between Malabon and Binondo since 1888. An \nanimal-pulled tramcar service ran between Talisay (Negros Oc¬ \ncidental) and Dos Hermanas from 1895-1896 owned privately \nby Esteban de la Rama. Also in Manila were horse-drawn vehicles \nfor hire: de luxe carriages of various sizes and shapes known \nas the quiles, invented by Lt. Col. German Quilez, politico-gover¬ \nnor of Cebu in the mid-188us; the araha, driven by one horse, \nand the victoria, by two, and, of course, the ubiquitous calesa \nand carretela. \nTo avoid traffic jams in Arroceros and Quiapo, the Puente \nColgante (now Quezon Bridge), the first suspension bridge in the \nFar East, was built. Measuring 110 meters long and seven meters \nwide and designed by Gustave Eiffel of the famous tower in Paris, \nit was two-laned for carriages, with the raised middle portion \nreserved for foot-travellers. Pedestrians were charged a toll fee \neach of one kusing (un cuarto or V2 centavo), while each horse \ncost three ciiartos (about 2 centavos). Tolls for carriages depend \ned on the number of wheels; the more wheels the higher the rates."

Indeed, Calle Hormiga, (meaning “ant”), \na small alley in Binondo, vividly describes the sluggish vehicular \nmovement owing to heavy traffic volume in Manila’s busiest \ncommercial section. In 1889, the first bicycle appeared on Ma¬ \nnila’s streets. \nShips sailed from Manila to Hongkong weekly, while the \nManila-Barcelona trip was monthly.

EDUCATIONAL TRANSFORMATION. \n• \nA. “La Letra Con Sangre Entra” (“Spare the Rod, Spoil \nthe Child”).—The earliest schools in the Philippines were in \ncompliance with Charles V’s decree of July 17, 1550, which \nprovided that indios in all the Spanish dominions: were to b4jf| \ntaught the conqueror’s language. As part of conversion, the\" \nSpanish missionaries in the Philippines used children in the belief \nthat they “would learn our alphabet, language, Christian doctrine \n.and customs, policies and transmit them in the town&afterwards.” \nThe Society of Jesus, as the teaching order, specifically believed \nthat their hope of a “brilliant” Christianity came from children. \n“The Christian doctrine was the milk they sucked” and “from \ntheir tender youth in the Jesuit residences, they were taught . \nand instructed 4n all virtues.” In fact, associated with Ihe policy \nof attracting the Filipino chiefly class to conversion was the \nfounding of a secondary school for “the sons of native ruling \nfamilies” in preparation not only for Christianizing but also as \nfuture gohernadorcillos and cabezas de barangay. Thus, the \nColegio de Ninos was founded in 1596, an annex of the Jesuit \nColegio de Manila established a year before. After five years, \nthe Colegio de Ninos folded up, due to lack of funds. Here, \nthe sons of chiefs were taught Christian doctrine, the rudiments \nof the three R’s, vocal and instrumental music, and handicrafts. \n1. Boy’s Colleges and Secondary Schools.—The earliest \ncolleges exclusively for sons of Spaniards were established in the \nPhilippines by the Society of Jesus: the Colegio Maximo de San \nIgnacio (1589) which later became a university (1621); the College \nof San Ildefonso (now the University of San Carlos), the sole \nsecondary school outside of Manila, i.e., in Cebu (1599); and \nthe residential College of San Jose, opened with only thirteen \nstudents in 1601. In the College of San Ignacio, there were \ntwo kinds of training: one was for the priesthood, and the other, \nfor a general secondary education. The curriculum included \nLatin, philosophy, canon and civil law, and rhetoric.

The Society of Jesus ably administered \nthe Escuela Normal de Maestros de Manila (1865-1901), the first \nnormal school to train male teachers for primary schools, estab¬ \nlished by the decree of 1863. \nAs Order of Preachers, the Dominicans also offered tertiary \neducation for boys and girls. The present University of Santo \nTomas, originally called the Colegio de Nuestra Sehora del San- \ntfsimo Rosario, in 1611, was converted into a Dominican Uni¬ \nversity in 1645. It was not until the last quarter of the nineteenth \ncentury when such courses as medicine and pharmacy (1871), \nnotary public (1878), philosophy and letters (1896), were in¬ \ncluded in the curriculum of the University of Santo Tomas. \nOpened in 1620, the present College of San Juan de Letran was \noriginally founded as the Seminario de Ninos Huerfanos de San \nPedro y San Pablo “for orphaned Spanish children.” Since 1640 \nit was known by its present name and is now considered oldest \nsecondary school in the Philippines. \n2. Girl’s Schools.—The first boarding schools for Spanish \ngirls in the Philippines were the Colegios (secondary schools) \nof Santa Potenciana (1591-1864) and Santa Isabel (1632), now \nconsidered the oldest school for girls in the archipelago. They \nwere originally founded for the benefit of orphan Spanish girls. \nBesides these, exclusive colegios for the daughters of upper-class \nSpaniards were called beaterios, established for young girls called \nbeatas who led a secluded life. These beaterios included the \nBeaterio de la Compama de Jestis (now the Religious of the \nVirgin Mary) founded in 1684; Santa Catalina de Sena (1696); \nSan Sebastian de Calumpang (now Sta. Rita College, (1719); \nSanta Rita de Pasig (1740); and Santa Rosa (1750). Two of these \n• \nbeaterios were actually established to teach Spanish culture and \nvalues to young Filipinas and were founded by Filipino women: \nthe Religious of the Virgin Mary (RVM Sisters) and the Beaterio \nde San Sebastian de Calumpang of the 6rden Terciarias de Recole- \ntos. \nThe nineteenth century saw the establishment of other \ncolegios for women: the Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepcion \nConcordia, now Concordia College (1868); Looban (1885), and \nAssumption (1892), which supervised the Escuela Normal \nSuperior de Maestras to prepare Filipino women teachers for the \nprimary schools.

Each town had at least two schools, one for boys \nand another for girls, aged from six to fourteen years old. Classes \nwere held daily, except Sundays and holidays, for five and one- \nhalf hours in the morning and afternoon, starting at 7:00 to \n10:00 a.m. and from 2:30 to 5:00 p.m. Classes were one hour \nlonger in the morning during the summer months from April to \nJune, and no classes were held in the afternoon. Subjects taught \nwere in the three R’s, Christian doctrine, morality and sacred \nhistory (taught by the parish priest), general geography and \nSpanish history, agriculture, rules of courtesy, vocal music and \nSpanish language. Pupils were forbidden to speak their own \ndialects. Girls studied sewing in lieu of agriculture, geography \nand Spanish history. Parents who did not send their children \nto schools were fined one-half to 2 reales. It must be noted \nthat education was free only for poor pupils whose parent’s \nincome was duly certified by the town gobernadorcillo and \napproved by the parish priest. However, wealthy parents paid \na moderate sum monthly. \nPropagandists, like Rizal, bewailed the defects of the educa¬ \ntional system implemented by the Spaniards in the Philippines. \nHe believed that “the cause of our backwardness and ignorance \nis the lack of means of education, the vice that afflicts us from \nthe beginning until the end of our careers.” Educational author¬ \nities, he commented, could not even provide the simple books \non morality, geography and the history of the Philippines “written \nin the language he speaks, since the immense majority of the \npeople are engaged in working and cultivating the soil and raising \ncattle.” Lack of schoolbuildings was the most common problem \nin every town. Rizal observed that the schoolhouse may be \n“the vestibule of the parish house, or of any other house” which \nserved as the temporary school, but which became permanent. \nAs it happened in many towns, the barracks, jail, or town hall \nserved as the schoolhouse. \nOn the student’s lack of motivation to study, Rizal explained \nthus: \nGenerally the spirit of emulation is not awakened in him be-"

Social Transformation.-Probably one of the indelible \nmarks left by the Spanish conquest on the Filipinos was the \nadoption of Hispanic names, as decreed by Governor Narciso \nClaverfa in 1849. Based on compiled names of saints, indigenous \nand. Chinese patronymics, flora and fauna, geographical names, \nand the arts, Filipinos were obligated to adopt surnames like \nRizal, Del Pilar or Luna, although some indigenous surnames like \nMabini, Malantic, Dandan and Panganiban, were retained. How¬ \never, the Catalogo alfabetico de apellidos contained some dero¬ \ngatory names like “Utut,” “Ung-goy,” and even “Casillas.” Not \nonly were Filipinos given family names as bases for census and \nstatistics, but the surnames also guaranteed exact tax collection, \nregular performance of polos y servicios personates, and control \nof population movement, thereby avoiding unauthorized migra¬ \ntion, tax evasion, and other abuses in the eyes of the Spaniards. \nAlthough strictly imposed in Bikolandia, some parts of Ilocandia \nand Panay, the change of family names was almost completely * \nignored in some areas of Laguna and Pampanga. \nThe bahay-kubo for the clase pobre of Filipinos persisted, \neven as the more affluent ones went to the extent of refining, \ndeveloping, expanding and metamorphosing this autochthonous \ndwelling into a bahay na bato with a wide azotea (from the \noriginal batalan), and sometimes retaining the banguerahan and \nproviding an aljibe or a well for the much-needed water supply. \nForeign cuisine, both Spanish and Chinese influenced the Fili¬ \npino table, smartly indigenized or mixed with the Filipino sinigang \nor pinangat. Filipino ingenuity is still reflected in the Spanish- \nintroduced but already indigenized dishes as the adobo, menudo, \nsarciado, puckero, or mechado, and the Chinese-derived noodle \npreparations which have been Filipinized into pancit Malabon and \npancit luglog. \nThe precolonial mode of dressing changed gradually with \nthe permanent settlement of the Spanish conquistadores. Thus, \nthe kanggan and bahag (loin-cloth) were transformed into the \nbarong tagalog or camisa chino and trousers, respectively. Hats"

The baro and soya for women continued to be worn \nexcept that it eventually developed into the mestizo, dress. Pre¬ \ncolonial fondness for jewelry and body ornaments was continued \nusing the Spanish-style tambourine, the gold and tortoise peineta, \nand earrings of different sizes and shapes. Indeed by 1663, \nFr. Francisco Colin was already describing the apparent change in \nFilipino clothing, saying that \nNow they have begun to wear the Spanish clothes and orna¬ \nments, namely, chains, necklaces, skirts, shoes, and mantillas, or \nblack veils. The men wear hats, short jackets [ropillas], breeches,- \nand shoes. Consequently, the present dress of the Indians in these \nregions, is now almost Spanish. \nNobody can deny the extent of the Spanish loan words that \nfiltered into the major and minor languages of the Philippines \nlike dasal from rezar, dalandan from naranja, and sinigwelas ^ \nfrom ciruela. Conversely, the Filipinos also contributed to enrich \nthe Spanish language camarin from kamalig, carinderia from \nkarihan, and molave from mulawin. \nWith the conversion of the Filipinos, fiestas honoring the \nsaints were introduced. From January to December, there were \nfiestas from the town to the barrio level all over the lowland \nChristianized Philippines. The births or anniversaries of members \nof the Spanish royalty were also occasions for festive merry¬ \nmaking. Indeed, it was not only a socializing factor but also \none of the most potent allurements for the yet unbaptized Fili¬ \npinos. The scattered “indios” of a barangay were enticed period¬ \nically to the town proper by means of the fiestas during Holy \nWeek, on Corpus Christi, and the feast day of the patron saint. \n“Not only did the fiestas provide a splendid opportunity to \nindoctrinate the Filipinos by the performance of religious rituals,” \nsays Phelan, “but they also afforded the participants a welcome \nholiday from the drudgery of toil.” The Filipinos released their \ntension through the pomp and pageantry of the religious proces¬ \nsions, the exotic Hispanic dances and music, and the religious \ndramas of the sinakulo and the komedya or moro-moro. In \naddition, the cofradios and sodalities of Filipino laymen and \nlay women honoring the Virgin Mary awakened in them a Christian \ncommunity consciousness which helped in stamping out pre¬ \ncolonial practices and even discouraging ritual drinking. \nCompadrazgo (ritual co-parenthood) came with baptism, and \nmarriages and further strengthened existing extended kinship"

Eurasian intermarriages resulted \nin mixed bloods or mestizos, who later on would produce leaders \nin the reform and revolutionary movements. Neo-Christian \nFilipinos soon buried their loved ones in public cemeteries. The \nfirst funeral parlor in the Philippines, La Funeraria, was estab¬ \nlished by Carlos March in Manila (1883) which advertised Euro¬ \npean-made coffins, embalming, “French-style packing,” tomb¬ \nstones, and guaranteed “permanent service.” \nIV. Cultural Transformation.—The precolonial bay bay in \n(syllabic writing) was supplanted by the Latin alphabet as part \nof the Hispanization of the Filipinos. By the mid-eighteenth \ncentury, it was observed that it was already rare to find a Fili¬ \npino “who still knew how to read them, much less write them. \nAll of them read and write our Castilian letters now,” wrote \nFr. Sebastian Totanes in 1745. However, Fr. Pedro Andres de \nCastro noted, as late as 1776, that he still saw in the Augustinian \narchives of Lipa and Batangas many documents written iti the \nTagalog syllabary “in order to understand profound mysteries \nand concepts.” Before laying the ground for the successful \nHispanization of the Philippines, the Spanish missionaries relent¬ \nlessly destroyed everything they considered belonging to the \ndevil, and replacing them with their own theocentric literature. \nAccording to James Robertson — \nThe early missionaries in the Philippines as those in Mexico were \nprone to regard the ancient writings equally with the objects used in \nsuch worship as was practiced by the native people as works of the \nevil one, lienee they ruthlessly destroyed these signs of culture \nwhenever and wherever found. \nThe potent appendages of education were the printing press, \nbooks and libraries. When the Spanish friars introduced the \nart of printing in the Philippines, their primary purpose was to \nfacilitate their work of converting the Filipinos. The develop¬ \nment from the xylographic (San Gabriel: 1593) to the more \npractical duplicator by movable typography (Binondoc: 1604, \nde visu copy), was in line with the desire to accelerate indoc¬ \ntrination of as many Filipinos as possible via printed religious \ntracts. Religion constituted the bulk of Fiiipiniana put out \nduring the Spanish regime. The three earliest books published \nat the Parian of Manila in 1593 by wood-block printing were: \nDoctrina Christiana, en lengua espahola, y tagala, Fr. Juan Co bo’s \nWu-chi T'ien-chu cheng-chiao chen-ch'uan shih-lu (A Discussion"

The earliest known \nde visu work by means of movable types was Ordinationes \ngenerates published by Juan de Vera in 1604. \nAs far as records show, the earliest known Filipino writers \nduring the seventeenth century were an unknown Tagalog laditio \n(bilingual) poet who wrote May bagyo ma't may rilim (“Though \nStormy and Dark”) in 1605, Fernando Bagongbanta’s Salamat \nnang ualang hanga (“Eternal Thanks”) and Tomas Pinpin's auity \nboth from Bataan, in 1610 and Pedro Suarez Ossorio of Ermita, \nManila, who left Salamat nang ualang hoyang (“Endless Thanks”) \nin 1627. In the eighteenth century, Gaspar Aquino de Belen, \nFelipe de Jesus and Jose de la Cruz (“Huseng Sisiw”) ranked \namong the more famous ones. \nAs early as the mid-sixteenth century, Spain had desired \nthat schools for the teaching of Spanish among the indios be \nestablished in their colonies. In May 1596, Governor Francisco \nTello was instructed by the crown that in order to make reduccion \nsuccessful, the Filipinos should be taught Castilian and the friars \n“should learn the language of the Indians whom they are to teach \nand instruct.” For instance, in 1792, Filipinos were strictly \nforbidden to speak their own dialects in convents, monasteries \nand courts, where only Spanish should be the medium of commu¬ \nnication. The Spanish friars were, however, uncooperative with \nregards to Spanish. They considered an uneducated Filipino who \nknew Spanish a future \"filibustero'” Having an idioma general \nor lingua franca meant national unity in a country like the Philip¬ \npines, with a diversity of languages. \nTheocentric literature appeared as soon as the Spaniards \nsettled permanently in the Philippines in the form of awit (do- \ndecasyllabic quatrain); corrido (octosyllabic quatrain), and me¬ \ntrical romances, written by early poets such as Ananias Zorilla, \nJose de la Cruz, and Francisco Baltazar. The dramatic versions \nof these forms were the anti-Muslim melodramas based on the \n“Moro Wars” — moro-moro or komedya, a European form of \n“comedias de capa y espada,” modeled after the Spanish obras \ncaballerescas introduced via Mexico. Dramatic forms were used \nsuccessfully as effective conversion methodology performed us¬ \nually during the Lenten season such as the pasyony which was \nthe vocal interpretation epic-style, of the dramatized version \nof the sinakulo, and the tibag. a replay of Queen Helena of Instan- \nbul’s search for the true cross.

H. Pardo de Tavera blamed the corridos “which consisted \ntheir profane reading,” the pasyons and novenas “which consisted \ntheir religious readings,” as the roots of “ignorantism” left by \nthe Spaniards to the upper and lower classes of Philippines society. \nIn fact, these readings constituted the bulk of the “very poor” \nFilipiniana collection of the first public library and museum \nopened, the Museo-Biblioteca de Filipinos in 1892. Understand¬ \nably, there were no books on political science in the library \ncollection which would have politicized the Filipinos before the \noutbreak of the Philippine Revolution in 1896. \nFolk, as well as colonial art, persisted with the Spanish coloni¬ \nzation. Christianity produced the variegated forms of Filipino \narts and crafts surrounding the religious fiestas. The visual arts, \nlike the making of imagenes, santoses, and jewelry, bloomed \nduring this time.

This \nwas exemplified by the Chinese mestizo painter Faustino Quio- \ntang, who flourished in the 1820s, producing Sedes Sapientiae \nand San Jose with Child Jesus. Damian Domingo, an insular, \ndirector of the Academia de Dibujo from 1827 to 1833, however, \nis considered the first known painter followed by miniaturismo \nartists Juan Arceo and Juan Transfiguracion Nepomuceno and \ntheir families. Two other contemporaries of Domingo were Seve- \nrino Flavier Pablo and Hilarion Soriano. Arceo of Paco, flourish¬ \ning in the 1830s, did religious paintings, and his son, Ysidro \n(“Y.A.”), produced his best works in the 1870s. In the 1840s \nNepomuceno and his son were credited with a series of litho¬ \ngraphic local landscapes and costumes for a French-commissioned \nwork. One of the painters of note was Antonio Malantic, famous \nfor his detailed paintings of famous portraits dressed in the di- \niphanous piha fiber blouse of the mid-1850s.

All these pockets of resistance for \nvarious causes burst into a national^ struggle as the Filipinos \nfought to liberate themselves from Spanish domination in the \nPhilippine Revolution of 1896-97. In October 1889, a group of \nilustrados in Paris, signing themselves as “The Filipinos,” ad¬ \ndressed the following “To Our Dear Mother Country, Spain”: \nWhen a people is gagged; when its dignity, honor, and all its \nliberties are trampled; when it no longer has any legal recourse \nagainst the tyranny of its oppressors, when its complaints, petitions, \nand groans are not attended to; when it is not permitted even to \nweep; when even the last hope is wrested from its heart; then. . .! \nthen. . .! then. . .! it has left no other remedy but to take down \nwith delirious hand from the altars the bloody and suicidal dagger \nof revolution! i \nLapulapu of Mactan (1521) and Dagami of Cebu (1567) \nwere among the first Filipinos to refuse to bow under Spanish \nyoke.

The ex-datus who regularly received the \nhandog (annual tribute or gift) from their barangay members, \nnow lost their influence although some of them who joined in \nthe pacification campaign of the conquistadores, were granted \nexclusive royal privileges of exemption from tribute and forced \nlabor, along with the retention of their patronymics, like Rajah \nTupas of Cebu, Lakandula of Manila, and Pedro Mojica of Cavite. \nThe babaylans, like Tamblot and Tapar, apostasized and desired \nto go back to their precolonial animism. In fact, some of the \nnative priestesses and priests in various parts of the Philippines \ncontinued the pag-anito surreptitiously behind the backs of the \never-vigilant friars, who declared them not only idolatrous, but \nalso unlawful. These religious leaders were soon superseded \nby the different waves of Spanish regular clergy.

Another fringe benefit the Lakandula and Soliman families \ngot was the exclusive right to keep their family names. However, \nwith Legazpi’s death in 1572, his successor, Lavezares, sequestered \ntheir landed properties and even tolerated the encomendero's \nabuse and oppression of their people.

Using magic, Tamblot \ncut a bamboo with a small knife and wine allegedly gushed forth, \neven as he slashed another bamboo, and rice emerged . In addi¬ \ntion, he promised his awed adherents that the “mountains would \nrise against their foe; that the muskets of the latter would not \ngo off or rebound on those who fired them; that if any Indian \nwould die, the [diwatas] would resuscitate him.” In no time, \nhe was crushed by Juan de Alcarazo, alcalde mayor of Cebu, \nusing a number of men coming from this nearby island. \nThe sparks of this rebellion spread to Carigara (Leyte), led \nby Bankaw, datu of Limasawa, who warmly received Miguel \nLopez de Legazpi in 1565 and supplied the Spaniards with their \nimmediate needs. Although baptized as a Christian in his youth, \nhe apostasized in his old age. With the babaylan Pagali, he built \nan appropriate temple to the diwata and pressed six towns to \nrise up in arms. Like the Tamblot revolt, the shaman used magic \nto attract devotees, saying that they could petrify the Spaniards \nand that woman or child could easily change the enemies into \nclay by simply hurling bits of earth on them. Alcarazo checked \nthe revolt in no time, and Bankaw’s severed head was impaled on \na bamboo stake and publicly displayed as a stem warning. His"

To inspire further terror on the rebels, three or four \nadherents were shot and one of the babaylans was burned. \nThe eighteenth century saw some significant revolts in our \nhistory : Dagohoy in Bohol, Silang in the Ilocos, Palaris in Pangasi- \nnan, and Magtangaga in Cagayan. The longest revolt in Philippine \nhistory was that of Francisco Dagohoy, a cabeza de barangay of \nBohol, taking 85 years (1744-1829) to quell. Although forced \nlabor was one of the causes of Dagohoy’s revolt, it was the Jesuit \nFr. Gaspar Morales’ refusal to give his brother, Sagarino, a Christian \nburial, on the ground that he died in a duel and had not received \nthe extreme unction, that triggered it. Sagarino was a constable \nof Talibon who was slain while carrying out the order of the same \npriest . Upon order of Fr. Morales, Sagarino’s rotting corpse was \nexposed for three days in front of the Inabangan church. With \nthe leading members of the Tagbilaran, Baclayon, and Dauis \nprincipalia and some 3,000 men, Dagohoy proclaimed “free \nBohol” in Inabangan and Talibon mountains and refused the \nunjust payment of tribute and rendering of forced labor. How¬ \never, Dagohoy did not live to see the end of the uprising which he \nsuccessfully initiated. \nAs in other revolts elsewhere, this was a consequence of the \nrealization of the Filipinos that the Spanish might was weak, \nas proved by their humiliating defeat with the fall of Manila \nin September 17G2 to the British invaders from the Coromandel \ncoast of India. Pockets of resistance also erupted simultaneous¬ \nly in the northern province of Cagayan, and in the hacienda \ntowns of Laguna, Batangas and Cavite. \nB. Religious Motives.-The continuous Hispanization of \nthe Filipinos through religion was in line with Spain’s policy \nof “Gospel, Gold and Glory.” Various attempts were made to \nproselytize the various cultural communities by employing a \nnewly Christianized chieftain or his children and family as shining \nmodels for the other barangay members to follow, or by using \na Christianized member of a converted ethnic community to \nevangelize other neighboring unconverted groups. Some of the \nuncompromising or apostates among them, however, reverted \nto their old beliefs instead of embracing the new religion. Among \nthem were Miguel Lanab and Alababan (1625-27), Tapar (1663), \nFrancisco Rivera (1718), Ermano Apolinario de la Cruz (1840-41), \nand, of course, the Muslims in the Southern Philippines, and the \nIgorots in the Cordilleras."

Alonzo Garcia and Brother Onofre Palao. Fr. Garcia \nwas eventually cut to pieces and his flesh thrown to the pigs. \nLanab and Alababan compelled the Isnegs to escape with them \nto the mountains, set fire to the churches, desecrate the images \nand loot properties. As a consequence, the newly-converted \nIsnegs voluntarily forced their people to turn “their backs on the \n[Christian] faith, fleeing to the mountains” of Apayao. In 1626, \na Spanish punitive force was dispatched to check the Isneg up¬ \nrising. A great number of palms were destroyed by the vindictive \nSpaniards to starve the Isnegs and forced them to surrender. \nA nativist revolt with religious overtones was led by Tapar, \na newly-Christianized babaylan in Oton, Iloilo, who proclaimed \nhimself “God Almighty” and who “went about in the garb of a \nwoman.” As a founder of a new syncretic religion, Tapar ap¬ \npropriated Catholic terminologies and did not find any need \nfor Spanish curates as he believed that they had their own “popes” \nand “bishops and priests” with aides, “Jesus Christ,” “Holy \nGhost,” and “Trinity” who could minister to them in their own \nway. In 1663, they slew Fr. Francisco de Mesa, burned the house \nand church, and fled to the mountains. By employing hired spies, \nthe Spaniards captured the principal leaders, who, in the process \nof defending themselves, were killed. However, their corpses \nwere carried back to the port of Iloilo with the alleged killers. \nSoon, they were fastened to bamboo poles in the Jalaur River \nas estuarine crocodile feeds, even as the woman who was named \nas their “Blessed Virgin Mary” (Maria Santfsima) was mercilessly \nstuck on a bamboo and placed strategically at the mouth of the \nLaglag (now Duenas) River to be eaten up by the crocodiles. The \nSpaniards used Cebuano mercenaries and the merdekas from Siau \nto repulse the Ilongos. By 1664, peace had returned to Panay. \nAlmost coeval with the Magtangaga revolt in Cagayan in Octo¬ \nber 1718, was another religious uprising in Tuguegarao led by \nFrancisco Rivera, a visionary who appropriated for himself the \ntitle of “Papa Rey ” (Pope and King). Together with his believers, he \n“deprived all the citizens and dependents of the Church” the \nfreedom of worship by instructing his adherents in Tuguegarao \nto give back to the Dominican missionaries the rosaries, scapu- \nlaries, and other religious objects. Rivera, thus, was described \nby a Spanish chronicler as “the only rebel chief with anti-religious"

He attacked the Spaniards led by the alcalde mayor who \nwere holed up in Lal-lo, the capital, fortified only by eighteen \nSpaniards, and killed more than fifty men in the assault. Only \na few of Rivera’s men responded as his Tuguegarao believers \ngot tired of his “irreligious and despotic” rule, and, in fact, desired \nto liquidate him. During this time, many people from Tugue¬ \ngarao, Cabagan, and the other nearby towns fled to the mountains \nand forests. The uprising was finally stopped by Juan Pablo \nOrduna who came from Vigan. \nErmano Apolinario de la Cruz’s revolt may be divided into \ntwo phases: phase I from 1832-1841 was from the founding of \nthe Cofradia de San Jose in 1832 to the death of De la Cruz in \n1841; and phase II from 1870-71, with the revival of the Co¬ \nfradia in 1870, terminating with the revolt and capture of Januario \nLabios in 1871. In December 1832, Ermano Pule, then barely \neighteen years, with the Filipino secular priest, Br. Ciriaco de los \nSantos, and nineteen others from Tayabas (now Quezon) province, \nfounded the cofradia centering around the cults of San Francisco \nand the famous brown image Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage \nof Antipolo. Five years later, the confraternity was named Cofra¬ \ndia del Sr. San Jose i voto del Santfsimo Rosario and proselytized \nin Tayabas and Laguna, particularly in Lucban (the founder’s \nhometown), Sariaya, and Majayjay. In 1837, the brotherhood \nappointed Apolinario de la Cruz as principal founder and pro¬ \nmoter, with Octavio Ygnacio de San Jorge (“Purgatorio”) of \nMajayjay, Laguna as hermano mayor. The cofradia met monthly \non the 19th day (honoring St. Joseph’s day), paying a monthly \nfee of one real (12lA centavos) and rice. As an incentive, a new \nmember of both sexes who could bring in 12 new ones was named \ncabecilla, who received one vote in the confraternity’s general \nassembly; if he initiated 12 more new recruits, he was entitled to \ntwo votes. He was promoted to the highest possible rank of \nhermano mayor when he recruited 48 members, which entitled \nhim to a maximum of four votes. The cofradta's existence was \nunknown to the Spanish authorities until 1840, although as early \nas 1833, certain Filipino priests have already noticed the group’s \nmovement in the areas of Mounts San Cristobal and Banahaw. \nErmano Apolinario de la Cruz was an ex-donee (lay associate) \nin the San Juan de Dios Hospital, even as he was admitted to the \nCofradia de San Juan de Dios which was open only to native- \nborn but not to whites or mestizos. He was not admitted to a \nreligious order because he was an indio."

Peasant Unrest.—In April 1745, the Tagalog regions were \nmarked by peasant unrest which started in the hacienda town of \nSilang in Cavite, spreading blood to the rice-growing provinces \nnearby. The maginoos of Silang disputed fraudulent land surveys \nwhich usurped a large portion of the communal lands in Latag \n(now Carmona) and Lantic which were unjustly awarded to the \nChinese and mestizo tenants of the Dominican-owned friar estate \nof Binan (Laguna). It is not surprising that it was a common \nsaying in Cavite that “land grows each year” in the province. \nLed by the principals of Silang under Joseph de la Vega, Fran¬ \ncisco Santos de Medina, Ignacio Marcelo, Julio Lopez de Montoya, \nAndres Pulido, and Francisco Gonzales, they assaulted the con¬ \ntroversial hacienda in April 1745 and razed the granaries and \nhouses to the ground in Latag and Lantic. Even as the attack \nwas going on, the hacienda towns of Cavite and Tondo rose up \nin arms, the unrest spreading as far as Meycauayan, in Bulacan, \nby June. By October 1745, the agrarian revolt spread to Batangas. \nHowever, the Tagalog rebellion failed and the leaders either put \nto death or banished. Some were sent to hard labor in galleys. \nBy 1822, another peasant revolt broke out once again in the \nvast hacienda towns of Cavite headed by Luis de los Santos \n(“Parang”) and Juan Silvestre (“Juan Upay”). Forty-eight ag¬ \ngrieved farmers, tagged as a “reunion of bandits” by biased co¬ \nlonial writers, joined up and the unrest spread to the rice-and- \nsugar producing, friar-estate provinces of Cavite, Batangas, Laguna, \nTondo, Bulacan, Bataan, and Pampanga. Actually, this peasant \nrestiveness was a continuation of a former struggle which origin¬ \nated more than eighty-years back in the upland and lowland \ntowns of Cavite and other Tagalog towns in Manila. What ag¬ \ngravated the already tense situation in Cavite were the forced \nlabor and exaction of tribute in the form of firewood for use \nin the Imus church construction. In fact, the so-called “tulisanes” \n(bandits) were really the troubled peasants whose survival depend¬ \ned solely on the lands disposessed by the uldogs (hacienda lay- \nadministrator). Parang and Upay temporarily surrendered to \nauthorities through amnesty in 1828, but resumed their uprising \nin the 1830s. Parang finally met his death by execution in 1835. \nCavite experienced another resurgence of agrarian trouble \nin the mid-1860s against the land abuses of the friars, with Casi- \nmiro Camerino, an Imus farmer unjustly labeled “El Tulisan” \nby the Spaniards, heading a peasant uprising with his other dis¬ \nenchanted followers.

The Moro Resistance .—The active resistance against \nthe Spaniards heightened from 1718 to 1762, and from 1850s \nto 1878, during the so-called “Moro Wars”. Starting with the \nreestablishment of Fort Pilar in Zamboanga in 1718, the Spaniards \nfailed miserably to subjugate the Moros in the 1750s. This was \nthe time that the Iranuns and the Maranaos of Lanao commenced \ntheir relentless ravaging pillages in the Visayas which caused \neconomic stagnation in many parts of the islands under the sway \nof the Spanish rule. Thousands of Christians were captured during \nthe Moro raids, resulting in the decimation of population in the \nVisayas. These “Moro raids” were in retaliation for Spanish acts \nof reducing Moro captives to slavery and razing their homes, \nlanded and personal properties to the ground. The British capture \nof Manila in 1762, and the pockets of resistance in Luzon and \nthe Visayas temporarily reduced Spanish attention on Mindanao \nand Sulu. By the nineteenth century, Sulu became the theater of \noperations of Anglo-French rivalry, with the latter eyeing a sea \nbase on Basilan in the 1850s at the time when the English were \nreactivating their trade with the Tausugs started earlier in the \neighteenth century. By 1876, Jolo had surrendered to Spain, \nand the “Moro Wars” were carried out mainly through the jura- \nmentado or sabil allah ritual suicide attacks, commencing an open \nresistance to the unwanted Spanish occupation of their ancestral \nlands. \nFailure of the Revolts.-“All the earlier resistance which \noccurred almost in cyclical pattern were failures. Because of the \ninsular makeup of the Philippines, the early Filipinos were con¬ \nditioned to live and feel apart from each other for almost 333 \nyears. There was no sense of national unity. As consequence, \nthere was a wide communication gap between the Filipinos of \nLuzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, particularly with those living in \ninaccessible areas.

Behind this \nsmokescreen, of course, was the fear of the Spanish friars that a \nFilipino who knew the Castilian language became better educated \nand, therefore, a future subversive or a filibustero. \nFilipino Nationalism: Decelerators.—Louis L. Snyder defines \nnationalism as \n... a condition of mind, feeling, or sentiment of a \ngroup of people living in a well-defined geographical \narea, speaking a common language, possessing a literature \nin which the aspirations of the nation have been expressed, \nbeing attached to common traditions, and, in some cases, \nhaving a common religion... \nThe ideas of nationalism, a product of the French Revolu¬ \ntion in the eighteenth century, filtered through the Philippines \nonly in the nineteenth century. Indeed, there was no national \nfeeling during the precolonial times. Although united as one \nin a geographical unit called Las Islas Filipinos during the Spanish \nrule, the people called Filipinos applied only to the Spaniards \nbom in the Philippines (insulares), and the indigenes were dero- \ngatorily called indios (like the Amerindians of the Americas). \nThe indios were not united in words and in deeds, as the Spanish \nchurch and state officials, mainly the friars, divided and ruled \nthe natives. Thus, the “‘indios” became a “Filipino” only during the \nthe last years of the Spanish regime in the late 1890s. \nThe divide et impera (divide and rule) colonial policy not \nonly quelled the revolts of Filipinos by Filipinos themselves, \nbut also by foreign mercenaries like the Macabebes (who belonged \nto Yaqui Aztec tribe), the merdekas from Maluku, or the Japan¬ \nese. In this connection may also be mentioned the superior \nmilitary technology and strategy utilized by the conquistadores, \nsuch as the use of Mexican horses, better firing projectile weapons \nsuch as culverins, cannons, muskets or guns vis-a-vis the primitive \nand simpler native weaponry of rocks, bamboo caltrops, pit and \nspear traps, spears, lantakas (rentakas) and non-firing side-arms"

Tired \nof being “only an individual . . . and not a member of a nation,” \nthe Filipino, particularly the social elites, finally woke up to the \nrealization that he must change. Change finally came about, \nstimulated by the opening of the Philippines to world commerce, \nwith the attendant rise of the clase media. Various factors such \nas the impact of European liberalism and the administration of \nCarlos Maria de la Torre, racial discrimination, the effects of the \nsecular-regular conflicts, and the Cavite Mutiny of 1872, all con¬ \ntributed to the birth of Filipino nationalism. \nA. The Philippines in World Commerce (1834-1898)— \nManila proper and the suburban areas developed by leaps and \nbounds with the official and permanent opening of the her port \nto international trade in 1834, resulting in tremendous socio¬ \neconomic changes for the Filipino. Indeed, the nineteenth cen¬ \ntury brought a great transformation from the preceding centuries \nof economic stagnation created by the monopolistic policy of \nSpain. Despite economic restrictions, foreign consulates were \nalready established before and after 1834; Russia and the United \nStates since 1817, France and Germany (representing Hamburg \nand Bremen) in 1835; Great Britain in 1844, and Japan in 1888. \nFollowing Sinibaldo de Mas* proposal, the provincial ports of \nSual (Pangasinan), Iloilo and Zamboanga were also opened in \n1855; Cebu in 1860, followed by Legaspi and Leyte in 1873. \nWith the opening of these ports ensued greater demands for \nexport crops such as rice, sugar, abaca, tobacco, and indigo, where \nFilipino and Chinese mestizo social elites profited highly. In \n1810, the total value of Philippine exports was only P4,795,000 \nwhich increased to P9,213,000, in 1856; P28,000,000, in 1870;"

However, in spite of this seemingly \neconomic prosperity, the Mexican silver dollar (peso) was devalued \nin 1875. In 1810, the peso was worth $1,030 (U.S.) $1,056, in 1856; \n$1,043 in 1870, plummeting to only $.976 in 1875 and $.531, \nwhen the Philippine Revolution broke out in 1896. \n. \\ \nMail service between Manila and Cavite started as early as \n1839, although postage stamps were used for the first time only \nsome fifteen years later. \nTravelers in the 1880s in Manila made reservations at the \nHotel de Oriente in Binondo, the first of its kind in the Spanish \ncolony. Of two storeys, with 83 rooms, it kept a stable good for \n25 horses. Fonda de Lala (Fonda Francesa) owned by Lala Ari, \nan Anglo-Indian, also in Binondo, however, was considered the \nbest hotel, good for 35 guests “with board and lodging including \nice”. \nBanking facilities were transacted at the Banco Espanol-Fili- \npino de Isabel //, the first Philippine bank which issued the first \npaper money in 1852, and two other British-owned banks.

Those with discriminating tastes had at least four choices \nof theaters: the Teatro Filipino in Calle Echague (now Carlos \nPalanca) in Quiapo; the Circo de Bilibid; the Teatro Zorilla on \nCalle Iris (now Recto Avenue); and the Teatro de Colon.

Rise of the Clase Media.—As a result of the great eco¬ \nnomic transformation in the life of the Filipino, a middle class \n(clase media) of Asian and Eurasian mestizos emerged in the \nPhilippine social pyramid. The clase media emerged from the \neconomic boom derived from expanded agriculture and com¬ \nmerce embarked on by the rising native entrepreneurs. They \nformed the town principalia, an elite social group composed \nof former gobernadorcillos and minor native bureaucrats own¬ \ning at least P50.00 in land taxes, decorated personnel, and school¬ \nmasters. \nPersonal possessions, as it were in the nineteenth century, \nas well as education, became indicators of social status in a com¬ \nmunity. The size, construction materials and location of one’s \nhouse in the town’s calle real (main street) improved one’s status. \nOf course, evidences of wealth and prestige, as ownership of \nlivestock, sugarmills, imported furniture and tableware, and use \nof honorary titles “Don” and “Doha”, enhanced the social stand¬ \ning of the local elites. Even the make and number of carriage \nwheels and horses that drew them were social gauges. Only the \ntown principalia and cura parroco owned such vehicles. Pianos, \nfor instance, were imported in 1893 for P6,207.00, increasing \nas much as P8,378.00 the following year. In 1893 the volume of \nfurniture imported was 106,014 pounds valued at P42,479.00; in \n1894 the volume were up to 429,019 pounds worth P33,863.00. \nThe rise of the clase media was highly visible in the residential \norganization of Manila society. Intramuros, up to the turn of the \nnineteenth century, served as the politico-religious center of the \nSpanish enclave in the Philippines. Within the walls was the largest \nIberian community seen in the Islands throughout the Spanish \nregime. In the pre-nineteenth century, only the Spaniards and \ntheir Filipino wives, permanent domestics and their carriage \ndrivers could live within the confines of the walled city.

The \nmestizo and Filipino social elites’ choices were either Binondo, \nErmita, San Jose de Trozo or Quiapo. In the 1870s, Binondo \nwas the biggest, as it was the business sector in the province \nof Manila, where Don Santiago de los Santos (“Capitan Tiago’V \nof Rizal’s Noli me tangere resided. Quiapo, known for its Black \nNazarene, was the residence of Filipino government clerks, artists \nand merchants. Tondo, then described as “all slums” was the \nmajor residential area of the Filipino close pobre: the lower \nworking class engaged in tobacco and cigar-making, fishing, and \ngardening for Manila’s local consumption. The Parian de los \nSangleyes outside the Intramuros was reserved only for the un¬ \nconverted Chinese and was relocated at least ten times at different \nperiods and sites between 1581 and 1790, which included Meisic, \na corrupted form of may insik. Binondo, on the north side of \nthe Pasig served as the second Chinese “ghetto” of the Catholic \nChinese and the mestizo de sangleyes. \nC. European Liberalism and Carlos Maria de la Torre.—We can \nnot discount that not only men, but also ideas filtered to the \nPhilippines with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. Thus, \nthe travel between Spain and the islands was made shorter, safer, \nand speedier. It not only “dispelled to some extent the atmos¬ \nphere of the middle ages” in which the Filipinos “were wrapped,” \naccording to Pardo de Tavera, but “modem ideas of liberty \nbegan to penetrate the minds of the natives.” We may add that \nthe Filipino migration abroad, the arrival of Spaniards in Manila \nwhose point-of-view had been changed by the teachings of the \nFrench Revolution of “Liberty, Equality and Fraternity” and the \ndemocratic influences which emanated from the United States, \nall contributed to erase from the minds of certain Filipinos “the \npernicious and false ideas regarding human rights which up to that \ntime had dominated most of those educated in the old methods.” \nInterestingly enough, the political term “liberal” was first \nused in Spain and first referred to the Spanish rebels of 1820. \nIn the Philippines, the ideas of liberalism may be traced to the \nsecondary and tertiary education made available to the Filipinos \nin 1863. For instance, the bulk of the curriculum in a college \nin the 1870s followed by one taking up courses in law, medicine,"

Two philosophers of the Age of Reason left indelible \nmarks on the Filipino intelligentsia of the nineteenth century: \nJohn Locke and Jean Jacques Rousseau. Locke in his Two \nTreatises on Government (1689) posited that the social contract \nbetween the king, who did not exercise absolute powers, and his \nsubjects, means that if the king failed to do his duty and did not \nrespond to natural rights, his subjects had the right to overthrow \nhim. Rousseau re-echoed the same principle in The Social Con¬ \ntract (1762), agreeing that if a government did not satisfy its \nsubjects, they have all the reason to alter the government to \nwhatever they thought best. \nThe “Glorious September Revolution” of 1868 in Spain meant \na new order with the arrival of the liberal Governor De la Torre, \nsucceeding Manuel Maldonado. In fact, the motto “Los hijos \nde los leones son tambiSn leones” (“Lion cubs are also lions”) \nwas spread far and wide by the partisans and sympathizers of the \nSpanish Republicans in the Philippines. However, De la Torre \nproved to be very unpopular with the Manila Spaniards and, of \ncourse, with the Spanish regular clergy, who overtly demonstrated \ntheir aversion for him. \nDe la Torre dispensed with his alabarderos (halbeldiers), \nthe governor’s security guards since 1590, and went unescorted. \nHe even used an ordinary straw hat, abrogated flogging for Fili¬ \npino deserters in the Spanish forces, and supplanted the penalty, \ninstead, with a month in jail. He abolished press espionage and \nproclaimed freedom of speech. To top it all, even went to the \nextent of meeting the peasant rebel leader, Casimiro Camerino, \nin the Imus hacienda. He shocked the Manila Spaniards when he \nled a group of Filipino elites in a toast to liberty. \nHowever, it was quite ironic that in spite of all these alleged \novert liberal reforms, Carlos Maria de la Torre, like all previous \nSpanish governors, covertly gave confidential instructions a few \nmonths after his arrival, to intercept suspect mail coming from \nEurope and Hongkong of prominent Filipino leaders and priests, \nincluding Fr. Jose Burgos. He even went to the extent of ordering \nsecret investigations to “procure evidence against them”. Indeed, \nDe la Torre was responsible for the arrest and imprisonment of the \nstudent leader of the Juventud Escolar Liberal, Felipe Buen- \ncamino, who with Paciano Rizal and Gregorio Sanciangco, headed"

Racial Discrimination.—There is an abundance of do¬ \ncumentary proof on racism in the Philippines during the Spanish \nperiod. “Although the laws recognized no difference between the \nvarious races,” commented Pardo de Tavera, “nevertheless from \nthe beginning of the nineteenth century the Spaniards claimed \nsuperiority over the Filipinos, and so taught their children.” He \nelucidates further by saying that \nA \nThe townspeople were obliged to remove their hats when a \nSpaniard passed, and this was especially the case if he occupied \nsome official position; if the Spaniard happened to be a priest; \nin addition to the removal of the hat the native was obliged to kiss \nhis hand. No Indian [i.e., Filipino] was allowed to sit at the same \ntable with a Spaniard, even though the Spaniard was a guest \nin the Indian’s house. The Spaniards addressed the Filipinos [i.e., \nSpaniards bom in the Philippines] by the pronoun “thou”, and \nalthough many of the Spaniards married pure blood native women, \nthe wives were always looked down on in society as belonging to an \ninferior class. \nThe intensity of animosities between the Filipinos and Span¬ \niards, especially the friars, reached the highest point with the \nReform Movement, when anti-Filipino writers like Fr. Miguel \nLucio y Bustamante, Francisco Canamaque, Pablo Feced, and \nWenceslao E. Retana, wrote vitriolic literature denigrating the \nFilipinos. Filipinos were maligned and degraded as “neither a \nmerchant nor an industrial, neither a farmer nor a philosopher” \nor that it was “logical that the Indians, in their immense majority, \nshould receive, from friars and seculars, the epithet of chongos. ” \nThe most virulent attack on the Filipino race came from the \nFranciscan Fr. Miguel Lucio y Bustamante’s Si Tandang Basio \nMacunat (Manila, 1885) who opined that the Filipino could \nnever learn the Spanish language or be civilized. With utmost \nbiases, he differentiated the Spaniards from the Filipino by \nsaying that: “The Spaniards will always be a Spaniard, and the \nindio will always be an indio . . . The monkey will always be a \nmonkey however you dress him with shirt and trousers, and will \nalways be a monkey and not human”. In fact, the Filipino, he \nbelieved, must remain tied to his carabao: “The Tagalog, that is,"

Pablo Feced (“Quioquiap\") was a \njournalist noted for his open hatred for Filipinos as shown in his \nFilipinas; esbozos y pinceladas (Manila, 1888), describing the \nrural folks as “carabao herd” and even quoting Fr. Gaspar de San \nAgustin, an Augustinian, who said that “God created the indios \ntogether with the rattan,” meaning that the Filipinos “need \nbeatings and the rattan.” \nE. Regular-Secular Conflicts. Secularization of the parishes \nwas nothing more than the transfer of ministries established or \nrun by the regular clergy to the seculars. By the midst of the \nnineteenth century, secularization was transmuted into a political \nand separatist movement which exploded in the Filipinization of \nthe church, and culminated in the separation of the church from \nRome during the Philippine Revolution. \n\\ \nAs early as 1583, Philip II proclaimed that parish adminis¬ \ntration pertained to the seculars. If there was enough supply \nof competent secular clergy, preference should be given to them \nin the establishment of missions. In 1753, Ferdinand VI pro¬ \nclaimed that there were enough competent seculars to supplant \nthe regulars in parish functions so that they could replace them \nimmediately upon vacancy. This was duly amended four years \nafter. Unfortunately, the cedulas of 1753 were not implemented, \nfor indeed, Ferdinand VI did not actually intend to secularize the \nparishes, but to put the regular clergy instead under diocesan \nvisitation and royal patronage. Actual secularization of the \nparishes took place during the tenure of Archbishop Basilio \nSancho de Santa Justa y Rufina (1767-87). \nAccording to Fr. Jose Burgos in his “Manifiesto que a la noble \nnacion espahola ” (1864), it was the friars who “have been utilizing \nthe infamous use of undervaluing the capacity and fitness of the \nFilipino Clergy so as to make themselves perpetual curates in \nthe Islands.” He described Archbishop Sancho de Santa^Justa y \nRufina as “wise and very worthy”. The Filipino, “by reason \nof his idiosyncracies, his character,” according to a biased Spanish \nwriter, is “good” only as a subordinate. However, the scholarly \nstudies of Dr. Luciano P.R. Santiago disprove otherwise the \nnotions perpetuated by both foreign and Filipino writers about"

He finally debunked the old \ntheory “that no native Filipino, or Indio, priest was ordained be¬ \nfore the 1720’s,” proving, for example, that the first known \nindio priest was B.D. Francisco Baluyot (1698) of the so-called \n“first group” (1698-1706) of native clergy. He also noted that \nearlier in seventeenth century, there were already Eurasian and \nindio priests, like Don Agustin Tabuyo of Cagayan (1621) and \nB.D. Miguel Jeronimo of Pampanga (1655). \nWith the Jesuit expulsion in 1768, a number of their parishes \nwere taken over by the seculars in Manila, Cavite, and the Visayas. \nIn 1774, the Augustinians, who were forcibly deprived by \nGovernor Simon de Anda of seventeen parishes in Pampanga \nwhich were given to Filipino seculars, filed a complaint before the \nSpanish crown. Anda was ordered in the same year to restore \nsaid Pampanga parishes, even as the King secularized the parishes \nwith the proviso that one or two of the more affluent parishes \nin each province should remain with the regulars. \nWhat the secular clergy believed to have been outright u- \nsurpation of the newly-established curacies of Santa Rosa (La¬ \nguna) by the Dominicans and Imus (Cavite) and Las Pinas (Manila) \nby the Recollects ignited further the age-old secular-regular \nconflicts. By 1803, the three named Tagalog parishes were given \nback promptly to the seculars, even as the governor-general as \nvice-regal patron, declined to follow the ecclesiastical cabildo's \npetition to the crown that the parishes continue under the regular \nclergy’s control. In 1822, Malate, formerly under the Augustinian \ndomain, was transferred to a secular priest. \nWith the Latin American revolutions for independence, \nSpain witnessed a complete alteration of her secularization policy \nby 1826 when all the parishes sequestered from the friars in the \neighteenth century were restored to them. There was seemingly \nno antagonism raised against the decree of 1826, but this was \nnot the case when the March 9,1849 edict gave seven new curacies \nin Cavite to the Recollects and Dominicans. Two Filipino priests, \nFr. Pedro Pelaez in Manila, and Fr. Mariano Gomez in Cavite, \nstood as the trailblazers in the nationalist movement among the \nnative clergy. \nTo the Filipino clergy the height of injustice was the 1861 \ndecrees which relinquished most of the secular-run parishes to the \nRecollects, as reparation for the Mindanao curacies granted to"

In the eyes of the Filipinos, this was a deliberate \nSpanish government ploy to dishearten and thwart the develop¬ \nment of the native clergy. Exactly a decade later, only 181 out \nof 792 curacies were Filipino-controlled. In fact, secular-regular \nconflicts arose in the Antipolo and San Rafael parish-grabbing \ncases, left vacant by their secular priests who died. Antipolo, \nfamous for its brown virgin, was considered not only as “la perla \nde los Curatos'\\ but also as “one of the richest [parishes] in the \nArchipelago,” as it was, and still is, one of the traditional May¬ \ntime pilgrimage sites, when “so numerous and valuable . . . gifts \n[were] offered in the masses” by her devotees.

On the same night, they revolted out of sympathy \nfor their kin and friends working in the artillery corps and govern¬ \nment shops, who had lost their exemption privileges from tributes \nand polos y servicios personales which they had been enjoying \nsince the mid-eighteenth century.

In fact, \nthis revolt was believed by one contemporary Spanish writer to \nhave stemmed from the workers’ strike (huelga) of the Cavite \nArsenal, the first ever recorded in the Philippines, and probably \none of the earliest in the Far East.

In the \nhomeland, meanwhile, the Filipino intellectuals secretly colla¬ \nborated with those in Spain and founded nationalistic societies. \nFor more than a decade the Filipino propagandists waged their \nwar of propaganda against the Spanish authorities and friars, \nbut they failed to awaken the Government of the Peninsula \nto the demoralizing realities of colonial administration. The \nreform movement was a failure in that it did not achieve its \ngoals. In another sense, however, it was a success, for its failure \nled to the founding of the revolutionary Katipunan with separatist \naims. \nThe Role of the Middle Class.—The economic development \nof the Philippines in the nineteenth century led to the rise of \nthe Filipino middle class. Non-existent in previous centuries, \nthe middle class, composed of Spanish and Chinese mestizos, \nrose to a position of power in the Filipino community and \neventually became leaders in finance and education. With the \nchange in status they hankered for official or bureaucratic power \nto make their position in the social pyramid more secure and \ninfluential. But the Spanish authorities looked down upon them, \nfor they did not belong to the inner circle of peninsulares — \nSpaniards born in Spain — whose prerogative it was to rule and \ngovern. This attitude was not surprising, for Spanish society \nin the Philippines was a sort of caste consisting of two well- \ndefined classes: the peninsulares or Spaniards born in Spain \nand the insulares or Spaniards born in the Philippines. The \ncontempt with which the former dealt with the latter arose \n129"

Thus, to show their contempt for the insulares, \nthe peninsulares called the former Filipinos. The “natives”, on \nthe other hand, were invariably called indios. It was not until \nGovernor-General Basilio Augustin called for the loyalty and \naid of the “indios” in 1898 that the latter were called Filipinos. \nBefore 1898, then, the Filipinos were called indios and the in¬ \nsulares Filipinos. \nThwarted in their attempts to win a “place in the sun”, the \nmembers of the middle class started, almost unobtrusively, the \nmovement for reforms. There was no alternative: the Spanish \nauthorities looked down upon them with condescension, if not \nindeed with contempt, while the “natives” looked upon them \nwith suspicion — the “natives” having been, and continued to be, \nthe victims of the mestizos' arrogant and insolent mannerisms. \nBetween the two evils — the contempt of the Spaniards and \nthe suspicion of the “natives” the middle class chose the lesser \nevil, that is, the natives. It was thus that the Filipino middle \nclass and the “natives” came to work hand in hand, with the \nformer naturally leading the latter by the hand. \nThe chance of the middle class to show their political color \ncame when General Carlos Maria de la Torre became governor \nin 1869. Identified with the revolutionary forces in Spain, \nde la Torre showed his democratic tendencies when he dismissed \nthe palace halberdiers, lived simply within his means, walked \nthe streets in mufti, and abolished flogging as a punishment. \nThe Filipino middle class saw an ally in him and, on the night \nof July 12, 1869, they marched to the governor’s residence \nand there serenaded him. The list of the serenaders was a roster \nof the well-known mestizos and insulares of the period: Jose \nBurgos, Maximo Paterno, Angel Garchitorena, Joaquin Pardo \nde Tavera, Andres Nieto, Manuel Genato, and others. Orations \nwere delivered, a poem was declaimed, and toasts to liberty \nwere drunk. It was a night of splendor for the middle class, \nbut it was also a night that the Spanish reactionary group never \nforgot. From then on, the middle class led the reform movement \nwhich was temporarily silenced during the decade from 1872 \nto 1882, when the Filipino intelligentsia, a segment of the \nmiddle class, took over the leadership from the wealthy segment. \nThe Nature of the Reform Movement.—The dissatisfaction \nof the Filipino men of wealth and intellect was centered around \nthe abuses of the Spanish authorities, civil as well as clerical."

As Spanish citizens, the Filipinos would be re¬ \npresented in the Spanish Cortes and thereby their representatives \nin the body could propose and participate in the approval of \nlaws beneficial to the country. As Spanish citizens, they would \nthen be immune from the abuses of the Spaniards and be freed \nfrom paying unreasonable taxes. Such a program constituted \nwhat has been known as assimilation. \nThe assimilation of the Philippines to Spain, that is to say \nthe transformation of the Philippines to a province of Spain \nand making the Filipinos fellow-Spaniards, was to be accom¬ \nplished in a peaceful manner. The rich and the intellectuals, \nthen, were reformers, not revolutionists, for they believed in \nthe power of words, and not of the sword, to achieve their pur¬ \npose. Approximately half of their number belonged to the \npropertied class and the other half to the intellectual class. It \nwas but natural for the propertied class to shun a show of force, \nfor an armed conflict was almost sure to affect their material \npossessions, to which anybody would cling desperately. The \nintellectual class, on the other hand also shunned revolution, for \nlogic and history were on their side; no uprising could have or \nwould have succeeded without the necessary arms with which \nto fight the enemy. In these circumstances, therefore, the two \nsegments comprising the middle class had to resort to peaceful \nmeans to convince the authorities in Spain to introduce bene¬ \nficent reforms in the administration of the Philippines. Hence \nthe program of assimilation. \nThe Great Reformists.—Not all the sons of wealthy Filipi¬ \nnos who went to Spain in the second half of the nineteenth \ncentury were in the propaganda movement. Some of them were \nthere to study in the hope that they would someday become \nsuccessful professionals and businessmen in their own country. \nOnly a few of them were connected with the movement.

He studied at the Seminary of Jaro operated by the \nPaulists, but it seemed that his study of religion and the atmos¬ \nphere of the seminary did not in the least affect his inborn \nqualities as a rebel. Even as a boy, he was already thinking \nindependently of his teacher. Endowed with the power of keen \nobservation, he saw the sad state of his country. Lively and \nhighly intelligent, he took to writing early in life, producing \na tale entitled Fray Botod. This work, which deals with the \nignorance, abuses, and immorality of a certain friar named Bo¬ \ntod, circulated in manuscript form. Its existence, however, \ncould not be hidden for long, and Lopez Jaena found himself \nthe object of a manhunt. Why so? Because he delineated the \naverage friar of the period — fat (botod is the Hiligaynon \nword for a big-bellied man, the equivalent of the Tagalog slang \nbotyok), ignorant, abusive, and immoral. The friars saw in his \nFray Botod their own picture, and nothing excites the anger \nof man more than to be ridiculed in public. There was only \none way out of the tight fix Lopez Jaena was in: to leave the \nPhilippines. In 1880, he secretly left for Spain, and enrolled in \nmedicine at the University of Valencia. He later transferred \nto Madrid, where he found the atmosphere congenial, for he \nloved light and shadows, the clubs and the cafes, and the jour¬ \nnalists of the capital. In social and political clubs, he dis¬ \ntinguished himself as a great orator. His speeches and orations \nwere, however, almost always about the condition of the Philip¬ \npines or a defense of the Filipinos against the malignant charges \nof Spanish hacks. One of his greatest oratorical triumphs oc¬ \ncurred in Madrid in 1882 during the celebration of the Inter¬ \nnational Congress of Commercial Geography. On that occasion, a \nfriar, Fr. Ramon Martinez Vigil, who had been to the Philip¬ \npines and had written an article on the ancient Tagalog script, \nwas praising the friars for their “benevolent” role in the Philip¬ \npines when all of a sudden Ldpez Jaena stood up and delivered \na defense of the Filipinos. At the same time, he denounced \nvigorously the role of the friars in introducing and maintain¬ \ning obscurantism in the Philippines and in obstructing the prog¬ \nress of the people. Somewhat like Lord Byron, L6pez Jaena \nwoke up the next morning to find himself famous."

There was \nwild applause after his speech, and the Venezuelan Minister \nto Spain, Dr. Calcano, sprang to his feet and embraced Lopez \nJaena in the name of Latin America. \nIn 1889, sensing the necessity of a newspaper to promote \nthe interests of the Philippines and the Filipinos, the Filipino \nreformists founded the newspaper La Solidaridad. The first \nnumber of this periodical came out on February 15, with Pablo \nRianzares as financier and Lopez Jaena as editor. The aims of \nLa Solidaridad, as expressed in its initial editorial, follow: \nOur aspirations are modest, very modest.

It \npublished not only news but also essays and articles about the \nPhilippines and the Filipinos. In 1891, at Barcelona, Lopez \nJaena collected his speeches and articles and published them in \nbook form under the title Discursos y Arttculos Varios. \nIt is to the credit of Lopez Jaena that he initiated the reform \nmovement which gathered strength as the years rolled on. So \ngreat was he as an orator that even Spaniards admired his command \nof their own language. He was fiery, and no one would suspect \nthat such a man of small stature and slovenly habits could sway \nthe masses of men to his side by the power of the spoken word. \nHe was slovenly and careless, as was said of him by his friends, \nso much so that he ate sardines with his fingers which he dutifully \ncleaned afterwards by the simple expedient of wiping them with \nhis coat. He was almost always in rags, and the Filipino colony \nin Spain felt ashamed of him and his eccentricities.

When after the lecture \nhis friends chided him for his inventions, he calmly answered: \n“If what I have said was not true, no one among those present \ncould belie me either, because on that subject they are as ignorant \nas I am.” \nAs editor of the So/, Lopez Jaena did not receive any salary. \nHis only compensation was free lodging, meals, clothing, and \na little pocket money for trivial expenses.

In the caf£ where \nhe spent most of his waking hours, Lopez Jaena would sit idly, \norder cups of wine, and magnificently allow others to spend for \nhim. Here in the cafe, his friends would give him sheets of paper \non which to write his pieces, and surprisingly enough, he wrote \nwith ease when his head was full of spirits. It was in this charac¬ \nteristic manner that he wrote most of his speeches and articles. \nBut such mode of living, such mental vigor without any \nrest and sufficient nutriment, could only lead to physical break¬ \ndown. Tuberculosis stepped in and challenged his oratory to \ndrive it out of his lungs. But Lopez Jaena was too weak to reply \neffectively, and on January 20, 1896, in Barcelona, the great \nFilipino passed on as a living memory. \nMARCELO H. DEL PILAR, the political analyst of the \nFilipino colony in Spain, was bom in the barrio of Kupang, \nBulakan, Bulakan, on August 30, 1850, the son of Julian H. \ndel Pilar and Blasa Gatmaitan. His father was a poet of sorts \nand from him Marcelo inherited his love for the arts. As a \nyoung man, he studied at the College of San Jose and later at \nthe University of Santo Tomas, where he finished his law course \nin 1880. His sense of justice led him early in life to campaign \nagainst the abuses of the friars, and since there was no free¬ \ndom of speech and of the press at the time he paid for his te¬ \nmerity with a month’s imprisonment. In 1878, he married his \nfirst cousin, Marciana del Pilar, by whom he had several children, \nwith only Anita and Sofia surviving. \nMarcelo began his career as his country’s evangelist in 1880 \nwhen he took to the field to campaign against the forces that \nstifled freedom and progress in the Philippines. He made the \nplaza and the cockpits, even the small tiendas, his platform, \npreaching the gospel of work, self-respect, and dignity. He was \na master of Tagalog and in this language he tried to arouse the \nconsciousness of the masses to the necessity of acting as a unified \npeople. In 1882, he founded the nationalistic newspaper Diariong \nTagalog. He wrote of patriotism and the sad state of the country. \nThe newspaper, however, did not live long enough to become \na major force in Filipino society. Nevertheless, del Pilar carried \nhis^personal campaign against the abuses of the Spaniards to \nthe different barrios and towns of Bulakan. Once, at a barrio \nfiesta, del Pilar heard a friar holding forth on the miracles of the \nsaints. He asked the priest: “How many miraculous saints do \nwe have in the Philippines?” “Todos, ” was the priest’s quick"

But del Pilar was smart. He left hurriedly and dis¬ \nappeared among the crowd before the guards’ arrival. \nThe year 1888 was significant to del Pilar, for it was in that \nyear that he gave his life wholly to the propagation of uncommon, \nat least in the Philippines, ideas. He wrote pamphlet after pam¬ \nphlet ridiculing friar sovereignty and exposing the injustices \ncommitted almost daily against the Filipinos. In the same year, \nthe Spanish friar, Jose’ Rodriguez, issued a series of pamphlets, \ndenouncing Rizal and his Noli Me Tangere. One of these pam¬ \nphlets Caingat Cayo, savagely attacked Rizal as an enemy of the \nholy Catholic religion. It described Rizal’s novel as a bad book \nwhich should not be read. Del Pilar- immediately jumped to the \ndefense of Rizal by issuing his brilliant pamphlet Caingat Cayo, a \nsearing indictment of Rodriguez’s pamphlet, using the pen name \nDolores Manapat. At the same time, the nationalistic Filipino \npriest, Vicente Garcfa, of Tanawan, Batangas, refuted Fr. Rodri¬ \nguez, using the pen name V. Caraig (V. Garcia). Not content \nwith defending Rizal, Del Pilar wrote the withering satire, Dasalan \nat Toksohan, a brilliant parody of the Prayer Book. Thus in \n“Amain Namin, ” a parody of “Our Father,” del Pilar said. \nOur uncle who art in the convent, cursed be the name, may \nwe be delivered from thy greed, may thy throat be slit here on earth \nas it is in heaven. Give back this day our daily rice thou hast stolen \nfrom us and draw our laughter by thy lowing as thou laughest \nwhen thou stealest our money; and deliver us from thine temptation \nand save us from thine foul mouth. Amen. \nDel Pilar also parodied the Ten Commandments to ridicule \nthe friars, the most potent single group in the Philippines. He \ncalled this particular work the “Ten Commandments of the \nFriars”, namely: \n1. Thou shalt worship and love the friars above all. \n2. Thou shalt not cheat them of their stipends. \n3. Thou shalt sanctify the friar, Sundays or holidays. \n4. Thou shalt pawn thyself to pay for the burial of thy father \nand mother."

He said: “Insurrection is the last remedy, especially \nwhen the people have acquired the belief that peaceful means \nto secure the remedies for evils prove futile.” He planned to \ncall the leaders of the reform movement to a meeting at Hong¬ \nkong in order to take steps toward the liberation of the country \nfrom Spanish tyranny.

At eighteen he won first prize in a literary contest \nin which the supposedly superior Spaniards participated. His \nwork was entitled A la Juventud Filipina. Later, his allegorical \nplay, El Consejo de los Dloses, was adjudged the best entry in a \ncontest, but he was not awarded first prize simply because he was \na Filipino.

And while we \nawait that Spain some day shall restore your good name and shall \ncease to be a party to your death, let these pages serve as a tardy \nwreath of dried leaves over your unknown tombs, and any one \nwho, without clear proofs, attacks your memory, stains his hands \nin your blood! \nThe Fili, in contrast with the Noli, is a political novel in which \nRizal predicted the coming of the Revolution. Yet because he \nwas essentially a man of peace, he made that Revolution fail, \nfor he conceived of it only as a peaceful, not an armed, revolu¬ \ntion. Thus, he put in the lips of Father Florentino, the kindly \nFilipino priest, these significant words: \nI do not mean to say that our liberty will be secured at the \nsword’s point, for the sword plays but little part in modern affairs, \nbut that we must secure it by making ourselves worthy of it, by \nexalting the intelligence and the dignity of the individual, by loving \njustice, right and greatness, even to the extent of dying for them, \n- and when a people reaches that height God will provide a weapon, \nthe idols will be shattered, the tyranny will crumble like a house of \ncards and liberty will shine out like the first dawn. \nRizal returned to the Philippines for the second time — the \nfirst was in 1887 — early in 1892 and was promptly arrested \nand thrown into Fort Santiago. On July 7,1892, his banishment \nto Dapitan was announced officially. For four years he remained \nin Dapitan helping his less fortunate countrymen, teaching the \nyoung boys how to be good citizens, planting fruit trees, doing \nsome business on the side, writing letters, collecting shells and \nsending them to his friend Ferdinand Blumentritt in Austria,"

His request was granted, and soon he was on a ship \nbound for Manila. It was at this critical moment that the revo¬ \nlution flared up. Rizal, not wanting to be involved in the revolt, \nstayed on the ship to await the arrival of the next steamer for \nSpain. When finally he left for Spain he thought that he was \nalready safe from the arm of Spanish law. But before the ship \ncould dock at Barcelona, he was placed under arrest, incarcerated, \nand returned to the Philippines. He was tried on charges of \ntreason and complicity in the revolution, charges which were \nabsolutely baseless. He was sentenced to die by musketry and \non the early morning of December 30, 1896, he was shot amidst \nthe frenzied shouts of the Spaniards. \nLa Solidaridad.—The last two decades of the nineteenth \ncentury were characterized by political activities never before \nwitnessed among the Filipinos. It was an era of growing po¬ \nlitical and social consciousness and discontent which found ex¬ \npression in the works of Lopez Jaena, Rizal, del Pilar, Eduardo \nde Lete, Pedro Govantes and others, who left the Philippines \nin search of freedom elsewhere. Lopez Jaena and other reformers \nfounded the Filipino Circle in Madrid in 1882 and even published \nits mouthpiece to bring to the attention of the peninsular Spaniards \nthe so-called Philippine problem. But the Minister of the Colonies \ndiscouraged the Circle and its mouthpiece, with the result that \nthe reformists were forced to disperse. In 1887, however, Eduardo \nde Lete and other Filipinos put out the newspaper Espaha en \nFilipinas which was to voice the desires of the Filipinos. The \npatriotic Filipinos at home collected funds as advanced sub¬ \nscription, but before the money could reach the editor, Eduardo \nde Lete, the newspaper had already passed out of existence. \nIt was at this point that the reformists in Spain thought of \npublishing an official organ. On the suggestion of Mariano Ponce \nit was agreed to continue the publication of the Espaha en Filipinas, \nbut the failure of the paper was taken a reason against reviving it. \nIn 1888, the expatriates in Spain proposed to the reformists at \nhome that a new organ be founded, a proposal that was accepted \nby the Manila end of the reform movement.

Lopez Jaena, not contented with \nmerely becoming a member of a Spanish Masonic lodge, thought \nof bringing together all Filipino Masons into * one lodge. Con¬ \nsequently, he established the lodge Revolution in Barcelona \non April 1, 1889, which was exclusively by and for the Filipinos. \nA year later lodge La Solidaridad was founded in Madrid. This \nlodge took in all the members of Revolution when the latter \nwas dissolved. These lodges became the focus of propaganda \nactivities in Spain and were responsible for the maintenance \nof unity in the ranks. The leading Filipino Masons then thought \nthat it was time to establish lodges in the Philippines. Pedro \nSerrano Laktaw and Antonio Luna were selected to carry out \nthis decision.

In one of their meetings, the Masons set forth their platform \nas follows:3 \nWe want a dignified, free and prosperous country in whose \nhorizons can be seen the splendor of the sun of justice and civil¬ \nization. We want a democratic regime, a genuine and effective \nautonomy of the human individual as against the enslaving pre¬ \ntensions of an ambition that nourishes its life in the absorption \nof the rights of the people and that waters its happiness with the \ntears of the needy. We want a good government and a good adminis¬ \ntration. We want o r country to be represented in the Cortds: \nnot a single Representative, not a single Senator is defending its \ninterests in the Spanish Parliament. Its government is dependent \nin Madrid upon the Ministry of the Colonies who, by and for itself, \nlegislates and governs the Philippines through Royal Orders, while \nin Manila the Governor-General executes and annuls the oruers \nof the Ministers.

In view of the increasing number of Masons, \nit was thought practical to establish other lodges throughout \nthe Philippines. As of May 1893, the Masonic lodges in the \ncountry numbered thirty-five, nine of which were in Manila. \nThe popularity of Masonry was such that even women joined \nit. The first woman to become a Mason was Rosario Villaruel, \nwho was initiated a member of the lodge Walana on July 18, \n1893. The other female members were Trinidad Rizal, Romualda \nLanuza, Josefa Rizal. Marina Dizon, Sixta Fajardo, Valeriana \nLegazpi, and Purificacion Leyva. It can be said that the pro¬ \npaganda corps was composed mostly of Masons, and it was this \nfact which worried the Spanish Minister of the Colonies who, \non April 4, 1895, sent a cablegram to the governor-general in \nwhich he said that “an alarm exists here about the separatist \nwork in Archipelago through Masonic propaganda that excludes \nall Spaniards and is directed exclusively by natives. I request \nYour Excellency. . . to inform me hourly of this, and, if true, \nto redouble the vigilance and to issue necessary orders to the \n[provincial] governors.” \nAt the outbreak of the revolution, Masonry was already \ndeeply entrenched in the Philippines. Though not directly re¬ \nsponsible for the revolution — Andres Bonifacio, however, was a \nMason — it served as a pattern for the methods and organization \nof the radical Katipunan. \nLa Liga Filipina.—Almost simultaneously with the intro¬ \nduction of Masonry in the Philippines, a civic society called \nLa Propaganda was established. Its members, composed mostly, \nif not exclusively, of the middle class, contributed money to \ndefray the expenses of the Filipino reformers in Spain who were \nwaging a campaign to obtain political concessions from the Mother \nCountry. The funds collected were forwarded to the Hispano- \nFilipino Association. In time, however, the funds of the organiza¬ \ntion were malversed, and the society passed out of existence. \nAt this juncture, Rizal stepped into the picture and proposed \nthe founding of another civic society. He had prepared a consti¬ \ntution for this society while at Hongkong and now he thought \nthat the time had come for concrete action. On the night of \nJuly 3, 1892, at a house in Tondo, Rizal founded and inaugurated \nLa Liga Filipina.

Yet the more hopeful among the middle class still \nhung on to the conviction that they could soften the heart of \nMother Spain into granting the reforms demanded. It is for \nto \nthis reason that the reform movement continued for four more \nyears or until 1896 when the masses, led by Andres Bonifacio, \nwere forced to take to the field against the Spaniards. Andres \nBonifacio, a man of scanty education but nevertheless highly \nintelligent, founded the Katipunan on the very night that the \nnews of Rizal’s deportation to Dapitan leaked out. Unlike the \nmembers of the middle class, Bonifacio and his plebeian asso¬ \nciates did not dream of mere reforms. They were interested \nin liberating the country from the tyranny of the Spaniards and \nthe only way, to their minds, to accomplish their end was to \nprepare the people for an armed conflict. Thus the Katipunan \nwas founded on a radical platform, namely, to secure the in¬ \ndependence and freedom of the Philippines by force of arms. \nThe Founding of the Katipunan.—The news of Rizal’s de¬ \nportation shocked and surprised the people, for Rizal to them \nwas the symbol of freedom. That night of July 7, 1892, Andres \nBonifacio, Valentin Diaz, Teodoro Plata, Ladislao Diwa, Deodato \nArellano, and a few others, met secretly at a house on Azcarraga \n(now Claro M. Recto Avenue), near Elcano Street, Tondo, and \ndecided to form an association called Kataastaasan Kagalang- \ngalang na Katipunan nang manga Anak nang Bay an, or Kati¬ \npunan for short. The men gathered around a flickering table \nlamp, performed the ancient blood compact, and signed their \nmembership papers with their own blood.

Also agreed upon during the meeting \nwas the payment of an entrance fee of one real fuerte (twenty- \nfive centavos) and a monthly due of a medio real (about twelve \ncentavos.) \nThe Katipunan Objectives.-TJnder the leadership of Boni¬ \nfacio, the Katipunan laid down three fundamental objectives \nor aims: political, moral, and civic. The political objective con¬ \nsisted in working for the separation of the Philippines from \nSpain. The moral objective revolved around the teaching of \ngood manners, hygiene, good morals, and attacking obscurant¬ \nism, religious fanaticism, and weakness of character. The civic \naim revolved around the principle of self-help and the defense \nof the poor and the oppressed. All members were urged to come \nto the aid of the sick comrades and their families, and in case \nof death the society itself was to pay for the funeral expenses. For \npurposes of economy, however, the society saw to it that the \nfuneral was of the simplest kind, avoiding unnecessary expenses \nso common under the rule of the friars. \nThe Structure of the Katipunan.—A study of the procedure \nand structure of the Katipunan reveals that it was influenced \nby Masonry, insofar as initiation rites were concerned, and by \nRizal’s La Liga Filipina as to organization. This is not surprising, \nfor Bonifacio was a member of the Liga and was also a Mason, \nbeing affiliated with the lodge Taliba. Structurally, the society \nhad three governing bodies: the Kataastaasang Sanggunian or the \nSupreme Council, the Sangguniang Bayan or Provincial Council, \nand the SangguniangBalangay or Popular Council. The Kataas¬ \ntaasang Sanggunian was the highest governing body of the society \nand was composed of a president, a fiscal, a secretary, a treasurer, \nand a comptroller or interventor. The Sangguniang Bayan and \nthe Sangguniang Balangay represented, respectively, the province \nand the municipality or town. Each of these had a council similar \nto that of the Supreme Council. The latter, together with the \npresidents of the two other councils, constituted the Katipunan \nAssembly. \nJudicial matters affecting the members of the society were \nreferred to a sort of court known as the Sangguniang Hukuman \nor Judicial Council.

Upon his request, Benita Rodriguez, with the help \nof Gregoria de Jesus, Bonifacio’s wife, made a flag. It consisted \nof a red rectangular piece of cloth with three white K's arranged \nhorizontally at the center. This was the first official flag of the \nsociety. But some members of the Katipunan had their flag with \nthe three K's arranged in the form of a triangle. Bonifacio himself \nhad a personal flag which consisted of a red rectangular piece \nof cloth at the center of which was a white sun with an indefinite \nnumber of rays. Below the sun were the three white K's arranged \nhorizontally. \nOwing to the lack of uniformity in the design and use of \nthe flag, some generals of the revolution adopted their own"

Thus, General Mariano Llanera used a black banner \nwith a skull above two cross-bones and the letter K, all in white. \nSo different was this banner that Bonifacio humorously called \nit “Llanera’s Skull” Still another flag was that of General Pio \ndel Pilar which consisted of an equilateral triangle with a K at \neach angle. Inside the triangle was a mountain with the sun \nrising behind it. \nWhen the revolution flared up, the Magdalo faction of the \nKatipunan in Cavite adopted a flag consisting of a red rectangular \nbanner with a white K in the ancient Tagalog script in the center \nof a sun, represented by a white circle, with an indefinite number \nof rays. Later on, the rays of the sun were limited to eight to \nrepresent the eight provinces which first took up arms against \nthe Spaniards. This flag became the first official banner of the \nrevolutionary forces and was blessed in a mass celebrated at Imus. \nIn the Naik Assembly of March 17, 1897, the Katipunan \nmilitary leaders decided to adopt a flag with a new design. It \nconsisted of a red rectangular cloth with a white sun and rays \nin the middle. The sun was the mythologic 1 sun with eyes, \neyebrows, nose, and mouth. This flag superseded the flag of \nthe Magdalo faction and became the first official flag of the \nFilipinos. It became the symbol of the Filipino nationality \nuntil the signing of the Truce of Biyak-na-bato on December \n14-15, 1897, when it was hauled down from the po^e of the \nrevolutionary headquarters at Biyak-na-bato. \nCelebrations ““The nationalistic temper of the society was \nshown in its annual celebrations. February 17 of every year \nwas recalled as the day of prayer in memory of the three Fili¬ \npino priests Gomez, Burgos, and Zamora. On that date, all po¬ \npular councils were instructed to erect a catafalque, shrouded in \nblack, with a torch at each of the four comers. The catafalque \nwas adorned with wreaths made of the makabuhay plant, the \nsymbol of immortality. The members entered in single file and \nprayed for the souls of the departed martyrs and swore to avenge \ntheir death. \nAndres Bonifacio.—Bonifacio, the founder and organizer of \nthe Katipunan, was born in Tondo, then a part of the Province \nof Manila, on November 30, 1863. His parents were Santiago \nBonifacio and Catalina de Castro. Andres grew up in the slums \nand never knew the benefits of a prosperous life. He had three \nbrothers and two sisters: Ciriaco, Procopio, Espiridiona, Troadio,"

The death of his parents \nforced Andres to give up schooling to shoulder the burden of \nhis family. Though very limited in his education, he was endowed \nby Nature with a beautiful penmanship and an interest crafts¬ \nmanship. He made canes and paper fans which he peddled around. \nWhen there was time, he made posters for business firms. The \nlittle leisure that he had was employed in self-study, for he was \na lover of books. Late in his teens, he was employed as a clerk- \nmessenger in the commercial firm of Fleming and Company. \nSerious-minded, honest, and dedicated to his work, he later on \nbecame the Company’s agent. He sold rattan, tar, and other \narticles of trade. His earnings, however, were not enough to make \nboth ends meet, and so he transferred to Fressell and Company \nas an agent. \nHis constant struggle to make a living did not give him much \nleisure to improve his mind. Nevertheless, he read books by the \nlamplight at home. He read Rizal’s two novels, The Ruins of \nPalmyra, Hugo’s Les Miserables, Eugene Sue’s The Wandering \nJew, the lives of the Presidents of the United States, International \nLaw, the Penal and Civil Codes, some novels, and a book on the \nFrench Revolution. Thus, while not fortunate to have a formal \neducation he educated himself by dint of hard work. \nIn his early manhood, Andres fell in love with a certain \nMonica, whom he later married. The marriage was short-lived, \nfor Monica died of leprosy. In 1892, he met Gregoria de Jesus \nof Kalookan and fell in love with her. After months of court¬ \nship, the two were married, with Restituto Javier and his wife, \nBenita Rodrfguez, as sponsors. After their Catholic marriage \nat Binondo Church, the couple were re-married according to the \nKatipunan rites. After the rites, Gregoria was initiated into the \nWomen’s Chapter of the Katipunan and chose Lakangbini (Muse) \nas her symbolic name. Henceforth, she took custody of the \npapers, revolvers, seals, and other paraphernalia of the society. \nHumble and self-effacing, Bonifacio knew his limitations \nand recognized the worth of others. When, after writing a sort \nof decalogue for the Katipunan, he found out that Emilio Ja¬ \ncinto’s Kartilla was better, he did not hesitate to set his own \naside and adopt that of Jacinto as the official “teachings” of \nthe society. Though the founder and organizer of the Kati¬ \npunan, he did not insist on becoming its president. It was only \nafter discovering that the first two presidents were not as serious"

To him the question of the \nsociety’s survival was a matter of life and death, for he knew \nthat the success of any society depended on its president and \nthe cooperation of its officers and members. \nIn 1895, Bonifacio, together with Emilio Jacinto, Restituto \nJavier, Guillermo Masangkay, Aurelio Tolentino, Faustino Ma- \nnalak, Pedro Zabala, and a few others, went to the interior part \nof Morong (Now Rizal) to find a place to hide in case of the \ndiscovery of the society. They reached San Mateo and Mon- \ntalban and found the caves of Makarok and Pamitinan safe \nplaces of refuge. Initiation rites were held in the two caves, \nfor many poor Filipinos joined the small group in order to be¬ \ncome “Sons of the People”. The Katipuneros, old and new, \nwent inside a cave and there, charcoal in hand, Bonifacio wrote \non the walls: “Long live Philippine independence!” Returning \nto Manila, Bonifacio plunged into a vigorous campaign to pro¬ \npagate the ideals of the society. He deposed Roman Basa as \npresident and had himself elected to take his place. Rumors of \nthe leakage of the Katipunan secrets were broadcast, and Boni¬ \nfacio, who had a one-track mind, had the rumors investigated \nand those suspected of having a hand in the leakage were sum¬ \nmarily expelled from the society. Such was Bonifacio’s person¬ \nality that no one dared to question the wisdom o is decisions. \nBut he was not dictatorial; he was, in fact, humble and tolerant. \nBut when the society’s existence was at stake, he never hesi¬ \ntated to take drastic action against anybody whom he thought \nwould defeat the purposes for which the Katipunan was founded. \nBonifacio may have been ignorant from the point of view \nof the middle class, but he succeeded where the middle class \nfailed. The middle class, in their naivete, held on to their mis¬ \ntaken belief that Spain would hear their cries for reforms. Boni¬ \nfacio, though not highly educated, had more insight than his \nintellectual superiors. It was this insight which led him to found \nthe revolutionary Katipunan for he knew deep in his heart that \nSpain would never grant the reforms demanded by the reformists. \nHis insight told him that only an armed conflict could make the \nSpaniards realize the folly of their bull-headedness. Bonifacio, \nthen, was the legitimate Father of the Revolution, and without \nhim it is extremely doubtful whether the Philippine Revolution \ncould have become a reality at a time when everybody seemed \nin despair without doing anything about it.

On the other hand, they found in \nBonifacio, a common man, a dangerous precedent, for Bonifacio \nstood for the use of armed might in attaining independence and \nfreedom. For the Americans, therefore, to promote the Boni¬ \nfacio cult was to defeat their own purpose of discouraging the \nFilipinos from taking up arms against them. It is only in the \nPhilippines were the leader of the liberation forces is not the \nnational hero. This is not to disparage Rizal, who was a great \nFilipino and who deserves all the honors that his memory now \nenjoys. The point is that Bonifacio should be placed <Tde by \nside with Rizal in so far as the national estimation is concerned. \nEmilio Jacinto.—Called the “Brains of the Xatipunan”, Emilio \nJacinto was born in Tondo on December 15, 1875, the son of \nMariano Jacinto and Josefa Dizon. As a boy he spent most of \nthe day in the streets and so came to learn a kind of Spanish \nwhich may be described as bamboo or pidgin Spanish. Being \npoor did not detain his parents from sending him to school to \npursue a career. He enrolled at San Juan de Letran College and \nlater at the University of Santo Tomas, where he developed \na taste for reading. At the ago of eighteen, he joined the Kati- \npunan, becoming the youngest member of them all. Membership \nin the secret society forced Jacinto to speak Tagalog, for it was \na rule that all conversations and discussions were to be carried \non in Tagalog. By a painful process, Jacinto became an expert \nin Tagalog and wrote most of his articles in this language. Honest \nand highly intelligent, he won the admiration of Bonifacio and \nsubsequently became his trusted friend and adviser. Bonifacio \nhad uch implicit faith in him that when the latter wrote the \nKartilla or primer for the Katipuneros Bonifacio did not hesistate \nto adopt it as the official “teachings” of the society. \nBonifacio and Jacinto were like brothers who never separated \nfrom each other if either one could help it. Separation came \nlate in December 1896 when Bonifacio went to Cavite to mediate \nbetween the two rival factions of the Katipunan in that province \nana Jacinto, appointed commander-in-chief of the revolutionary \nforces in Laguna, went to this province to direct the movements \nof the revolutionists.

Bonifacio \ndied two years earlier than Jacinto who, while directing a \ncampaign against the Spaniards in Mahayhay, Laguna, contracted \nfever and died on April 16,1899. \nJacinto, as the “Brains of the Katipunan”, was the author of \narticles which influenced the masses to join the society and to \nmake sacrifices for the welfare of the native land. He was the \neditor of the society’s newspaper Kalayaan (Freedom) which \nvoiced the aspirations of the people. The secret of Jacinto’s \nsuccess as a propaganda writer lies in the simplicity of his style, \na style that reflected his personality. Precisely because of the \nsimplicity of his style, the masses understood him and felt the \npower of his words. \nAside from the Kartilla, Jacinto wrote Liwanag at Dilim \n(Light and Darkness), Pahayag (Manifesto), Sa mga Kababayan \n(To My Countrymen), Ang Kasalanan ni Cam (Cain’s Sin), Pag- \nkatatag ng P&mahalaan sa Hukuman ng Silangan (Establishment \nof the Provincial Government of Laguna), and Samahan ng Bay an \nsa Pangangalakal (Commercial Association of the People). \nThe Teachings of the Katipunan.—Realizing the importance \nof a primer to indoctrinate the members of the society in its \nideals, Jacinto prepared one which he called Kartilla, a word \nadopted from the Spanish cartilla which at the time meant a \nprimer for grade school students. The Kartilla consisted of \nthirteen “teachings” which the members of the society were \nexpected to follow. The primer follows: \nI. Life which is not consecrated to a lofty and sacred cause \nis like a tree without a shadow, if not a poisonous weed. \nII. A good deed that springs from a desire for personal profit \nand not from a desire to do good is not kindness. \nIII. True greatness consists in being charitable, in loving one’s \nfellow-men and in adjusting every movement, deed and \nword to true Reason. \nIV. All men are equal, be the color of their skin black or white. \nOne may be superior to another in knowledge, wealth \nand beauty, but cannot be superior in being. \nV. He who is noble prefers honor to personal gains; he who \nis mean prefers personal profit to honor. \nVI. To a man with a sense of shame, his word is inviolate."

Doubt¬ \nless, Bonifacio knew that the strength of a society with pur¬ \nposes such as those of the Katipunan lay in numbers. Conse¬ \nquently, in the middle of 1893, soon after his second marriage, \nhe opened the door of the society to patriotic and scrupulous \nwomen who had the virtue to keep their tongues in place. To \nbe sure that no woman of dubious character could penetrate \nthe deep secrets of the society, Bonifacio limited the member¬ \nship to the wives, daughters, and sisters of the male members. \nIt was their duty to take in new members, male or female, and, \nmore important from the point of view of security, to see to it \nthat the meetings of the male members were not disturbed by \nsurprise raids of the authorities. Thus, while the men were hold¬ \ning their meeting in the backroom, the women, in order to draw \naway the suspicion of the authorities, danced and sang in the \nsala in full view of the passersby. It was thus that the women \nmembers acted as a front for the clandestine goings-on of the \nKatipuneros. \nProminent women of the community were initiated into the \nsociety.

In particular, Gregoria de Jesus risked her \nlife in keeping in her person many Katipunan documents even \nat a time when she was heavy with child. \nThe Katipunan Newspaper.—Another step taken by the Ka¬ \ntipunan to propagate its teachings and to win more adherents \nto its side was the establishment of a printing press. One dif¬ \nficulty encountered was the lack of sufficient funds with which \nto purchase even a small printing press adequate enough to meet \nthe simple needs of the society. Fortunately, however, two \nKatipuneros from the Visayas, Candida Iban and Francisco \ndel Castillo, who came back from Australia in 1895, had one \nthousand pesos between them for having won in the lottery. \nWith a magnificent gesture, the two bought the small printing \npress of Bazar El Cisne, then located at the comer of what are \nnow Carriedo and Rizal Avenue. Its owner, Antonio Salazar, \nagreed to part with his press for four hundred pesos. The press \nwas transferred to Andres Bonifacio’s house on what is now \nOroquieta Street near Zurbaran. With a proud conscience, Iban \nand del Castillo returned to Kalibo, Kapis, to spread the doctrines \nof the Katipunan. \nThe printing press lacked many types, particularly the letter \na, the much-employed letter in Tagalog. Jacinto, who was much \ninterested in the press, borrowed twenty pesos from his mother \nand with it he bought some types from Isabelo de los Reyes, a \ngreat Filipino nationalist. But even with these types the facilities \nof the press were inadequate, for other types were lacking and \nwithout them no printing job could be done. The problem was \nsolved by four Katipuneros employed at the printing establish¬ \nment of the popular daily Diario de Manila. They stole types \nfrom the printing plant of this Spanish-owned periodical and gave \nthem to Dr. Pio Valenzuela. On the latter’s suggestion, the \nprinting press was moved to his place of residence — at No. 35 \n(until recently No. 408) Lavezares Street, San Nicolas, a place \nfound convenient for the printing of the proposed organ of the \nsociety. To manage the press, Valenzuela asked the help of \nUlpiano Fernandez, a printer in the printing plant of the daily \nEl Comercio, and Faustino Duque, a student of San Juan de \nLetran. \nValenzuela suggested the name Kalayaan for the society’s \norgan, and Jacinto and Bonifacio approved it.

It was also \nagreed that to fool the Spanish authorities as to the place of \nprinting, Yokohama should be placed on the masthead. For \nweeks, day and night, Valenzuela, Duque, and Fernandez took \nturns at preparing the pages of the Kalayaan, which was ap¬ \nproximately nine by twelve inches in size. Two thousand copies \nof the first number, dated January 18, 1896, were printed the \nhard way. The paper actually came out in mid-March. \nThe first number contained a supposed editorial of del Pilar \nwhich, in fact, Jacinto wrote. It greeted the people and wished \nthem “solidarity and independence” and offered them his “life \nand all he had for the good of the Filipino people.” There was \nan article by Jacinto, Valenzuela’s Catuiran? (Is it Right?) which \ndescribed the cruelties of the Spanish priest and civil guards \nof San Francisco del Monte (now in Quezon City) on a helpless \nvillage lieutenant, Jacinto’s Manifesto which urged the Filipinos \nto revolt against the Spaniards to secure their liberty, Bonifacio’s \npoem Pag-ibig sa Tinubuang Bayan (Love of Country), and a \nsprinkling of news. For obvious reasons, Jacinto Valenzuela, \nand Bonifacio wrote under their pen names: Dimas-Ilaw, for \nJacinto; Agap-ito Bagumbayan, for Bonifacio; and Madlang- \nAway> for Valenzuela. \nCopies of the first number were secretly distributed in Ma¬ \nnila, Cavite, Morong (now Rizal province), Kalookan, Malabon, \nand other places. Encouraged by the success of this initial \nnumber, Jacinto began to prepare a second number which would \ncontain nothing but his works. But time was running out on the \nKalayaan. When the type was already set and the paper about \nready to “go to bed,” that is, about to be printed, the Spanish \nauthorities, who had suspected the periodical to be in or around \nManila, raided the place where the paper was being printed, \nwhich was then at No. 6 (until recently No. 712) Clavel Street, \nSan Nicolas. But before the authorities could lay hold of the \npress, Duque and Fernandez had already destroyed it. Then the \ntwo separated, never to meet again.

But as the number \nof its affiliates increased, the Spanish authorities began to suspect \nits underground character. The friars began to denounce the \nnightly meeting held by the Katipuneros and on August 19,1896, \nPatino exposed the society to Fr. Mariano Gil. With the discoveiy \nof the Katipunan, Bonifacio had no other alternative than to \ntake to the field and on August 23, at Pugadlawin, he and his \nmen declared their intention to fight to the bitter end. The \nrevolution spread to other provinces. In Cavite, meanwhile, \nthe two factions of the society were at loggerheads and Bonifacio \nwas invited to mediate between them. At Tejeros, it was agreed \nto change the society with a government responsive to the \ndemands of thp times, and in the election that followed Bonifacio \nwas chosen Director of the Interior. Unfortunately, his election \nwas questioned by Daniel Tirona. Bonifacio, hurt by the insult, \ndeclared the results of the election null and void. In April, he \nwas ordered arrested, tried, and executed. The Filipinos were \nat the time losing battle after battle. Aguinaldo retreated to \nBiyak-na-bato, where the Republic was founded. Later, in De¬ \ncember, the Truce of Biyak-na-bato was concluded between \nthe rebels and the Spanish Government. The Truce, however, \nwas a failure. \nRizal and the Revolution.—Bonifacio, who had known Rizal \nduring the Liga\\ days but whom Rizal did not know personally, \nwanted Rizal’s opinion on the necessity of rising in arms against \nthe Spaniards. He, therefore, commissioned Dr. Pfo Valenzuela \nto go to Dapitan in June 1896 to confer with Rizal. With Valen¬ \nzuela on the S.S. Venus were Rizal’s sister Narcisa and his niece \nAngelica Rizal Lopez. The ship cast anchor at the port of Dapitan \nin the late afternoon of June 21. Valenzuela immediately pro¬ \nceeded to Rizal’s home. In the evening after supper, Valenzuela \nwhispered to Rizal the real purpose of his visit.

Told that the revolution might \nbreak out prematurely because of the impatience of the masses, \nRizal pointed out that a revolution without sufficient arms should \nnot be started against an armed nation. He remembered the first \nCuban revolution against Spain which failed because of lack of \narms. Even so, he suggested that influential and wealthy Filipinos \nbe attracted to the cause of the society in order to ensure the \nsuccess of the revolution. In such a case, he said, there would \nbe unity among all classes of Filipinos. Knowing that the society \nhad no competent military leadership, he suggested that Antonio \nLuna be appointed to direct all military operations against the \nenemy. Valenzuela pointed out the difficulty of winning over \nthe wealthy Filipinos to the Katipunan side. This was one \nproblem to which Rizal failed to suggest a solution. \nIt is obvious that Rizal was not against revolution in itself, \nbut was against it only in the absence of preparation and arms \non the part of the rebels. This was because Rizal feared that \nwithout arms the rebels would surely be defeated and thereby \ncause irreparable damage to the innocent people. His knowledge \nof the history of revolutions in other lands led him to believe that \nany revolution was useless unless the rebels were at least as armed \nas the enemy. After the interview, Valenzuela sailed back to Manila \nand reported the results of his mission to Bonifacio. The latter, \nhaving been apprised of Rizal’s opinions, admitted that it would \nbe fatal for them to start a revolution without enough arms \nwith which to fight the enemy. \nPreparations for the Struggle.*—Meanwhile, the Katipunan \nbegan preparations geared for any emergency. Bonifacio thought \nthat sooner or later the revolution would explode, and he did \nnot want to be taken by surprise. Consequently, he ordered the \nmanufacture of bolos to be distributed to the members of the \nsociety. Bolos alone, however, would *not do, for the enemy \nwas armed with Remingtons and Mausers. A ray of hope shone \non the Katipuneros when Valenzuela told Bonifacio that the \nJapanese warship Kongo, with Admiral Kanimura on board, \nhad dropped anchor at Manila Bay and that it might be possible \nfor them to seek the aid of the admiral in the struggle for na¬ \ntional liberation. Contacts were made through Jose Moritaro \nTagawa, a Japanese employee of a Japanese bazaar, and soon \nthe Katipunan committee headed by Bonifacio himself had an \ninterview with Admiral Kanimura. The interview was cordial, \nbut the Japanese refused to commit his country to the revolu-"

He thought of the Katipuneros in the various \nbranches of the government and sought to use them as his tools. \nHe called two of them, Tito Miguel and Roman Ramos, who \nwere employed in the Maestranza (arsenal), and ordered them \nto steal rifles and pistols, for the Maestranza was a place where \nthe ordinance was located. Through this expediency the weapons \nof the Katipunan increased. Even so, the quantity of such \nweapons was not sufficient to start a revolution. More bolos \nwere ordered and hidden to prevent the authorities from dis¬ \ncovering the intentions of the society. \nSpanish Suspicion Aroused.—-The increase in the number of \nthe Katipunan affiliates, while advantageous to Bonifacio, was \nin a way a disadvantage. The new members were impatient \nand in their impatience they met nightly, a circumstance that \naroused the suspicion of the authorities. Rumors or such \nnocturnal meetings reached Manila, and the Spanish population, \nparticularly the friars, became jittery. From Batangas, a rumor \ncirculated that there were secret gatherings and that rifles and \nammunition from Hongkong and Yokohama were being landed. \nThe friars exploited this rumor to advantage by telling the \ngovernor-general to act at once in order to prevent a bloody up¬ \nrising. Blanco, the governor-general, was reluctant to act upon the \nsuggestion of the friars, for he was not exactly sympathetic to the \nfriars. Nevertheless, he banished all the prominent men of Malolos, \nBulacan, in 1895, and those of Taal, Batangas in 1896. The friar \ncampaign of vilification now began. On June 20,1896, a Recollect \nfriar in Cavite denounced the alleged existence of a group of \nmen who met at banquets to toast the victory of the Cuban \nrebels against the Spaniards. Another rumor had it that there \nwere some 17,000 rebels in the town of San Juan del Monte, \nSan Felipe Neri, San Pedro Makati, Pasig, and Caimito. The \nparish priest of Guadalupe, listening to a rumor-monger that was \nhis servant, denounced the existence of an alleged secret society \nin his parish to the governor-general. The curate of Santa Cruz, \nManila, reported to the authorities alleged secret meetings of \nsuspicious persons in Manila. \nIn spite of these reports, most of which were exaggerated \nand calculated to force the governor-general to act precipitately,"

Instead, he rebuked the \nfriars and told Father Mariano Gil’s messenger: “Undeceive \nyourself, freemasonry and filibustering are like a pit in which \nyou put your finger and at once you touch the bottom. Both \nevils exist only in the minds of the friars and a few other fanatical \nSpaniards.” The friars, undaunted by their rebuff, continued \nto pester the governor-general with more reports of alleged secret \nmeetings. To them, the governor-general was a fathead who could \nnot make up his mind. \nThe Discovery of the Katipunan.-- Father Mariano Gil dis¬ \ngusted over the governor’s attitude, next ran to the military \ngovernor of Manila, General Echaluce, and revealed what he \nknew about the Katipunan. But Echaluce was not in a mood \nto humor the friar. Instead, he took precautions to make Manila \nsafe from disturbances of any kind. \nAt almost the same time, however, an unfortunate incident \ntook place between two Katipuneros who were working in the \nSpanish-owned Diario de Manila. Apolonio de la Cruz and Teo- \ndoro Patino had a misunderstanding and Patino, weakling that \nhe was, took his revenge on Apolonio by revealing the secrets \nof the society to his sister, Honoria. The latter, an inmate at \nthe orphanage in Mandaluyong, was reported to have cried. \nThe madre portera,, Sor Teresa, when informed of the cause of \nthe girl’s alleged grief, suggested that Teodoro Patino tell all \nhe knew to Father Mariano Gil. In the afternoon of August \n19, Patino told Father Mariano of whajt he knew about the secret \nsociety. The friar immediately hurried to the printing shop of \nthe Diario de Manila and, accompanied by the owner of the \nperiodical, searched the premises for the hidden proofs of the \nexistence of the Katipunan. The lithographic stone used to \nprint the Katipunan receipts was found and when it was shown \nto Patino the latter pronounced it genuine. At midnight, the \nlocker of Policarpio Turla, whose signature appeared in the re¬ \nceipts, was forced open and there a dagger, the rules of the \nsociety, and other pertinent documents were found. These \nproofs were turned over to the police, who were now convinced \nof the existence of a vast underground society whose purpose \nwas the overthrow Spanish sovereignty in the Philippines. \n% \nThe discovery of the Katipunan was immediately followed \nby mass arrests of Filipino suspects. Prominent men, numbering \nabout 500, were rounded up and convicted of illegal association \nand treason. Others, though innocent, were thrown into jail"

That night, Manila hardly slept, for the Fili¬ \npinos did not know when they would be arrested and tortured \nwithout even a semblance of reason. \nWealthy Filipinos Implicated.—As Valenzuela feared, the \nwealthy Filipinos refused to join the Katipunan. Bonifacio \nthought that in order to force them to sympathize with the \nmembers of the society a trick should be played on them in such \na way as to make it appear that they were deeply involved in \nthe Katipunan. Jacinto then drew up a list of wealthy Filipinos, \nwhile some of the Katipuneros were ordered to study their \nsignatures for the purpose of forging them on some documents \nthey were about to prepare. This done, fake letters with the \nforged signatures of the wealthy victims were made. The alleged \ndocuments contained the information that such wealthy men \nas Luis R. Yangco, Frincisco L. Roxas, and others, were heavy \ncontributors to the Katipunan fund and that they were in sym¬ \npathy with the principles and plans of the society. The result \nof this trick was unexpected: instead of forcing the wealthy \nFilipinos to join or contribute to the society they denounced \nit and denied any knowledge of its existence. But their excuses \nwere of no avail, for the authorities simply refused to believe \nthem. Francisco L. Roxas was executed, while Yangco and \nothers were saved by bribing some highly-placed Spanish officials. \nThe “Cry” of Pugadlawin.—The news of the discovery of \nthe Katipunan spread throughout Manila and the suburbs.

That \nsame night of August 19, Bonifacio, accompanied by his brother \nProcopio, Emilio Jacinto, Teodoro Plata, and Aguedo del Ro¬ \nsario, slipped through the cordon of Spanish sentries and reached \nBalintawak before midnight. Pfo Valenzuela followed them \nthe next day. On the 21st Bonifacio changed the Katipunan \ncode because the Spanish authorities had already deciphered it. \nIn the afternoon of the same day, the rebels, numbering about \n500, left Balintawak for Kangkong, where Apolonio Samson, a \nKatipunero, gave them food and shelter. In the afternoon of \nAugust 22, they proceeded to Pugadlawin. The following day, \nin the yard of Juan A.

Despite the objection of his brother-in-law, Teodoro Plata, \nall assembled agreed to fight to the last. “That being the case,” \nBonifacio said, “bring out your cedulas and tear them to pieces \nto symbolize our determination to take up arms!” The men \nobediently tore up their cedulas, shouting: “Long live the Phil¬ \nippines!” This event marked the so-called “Cry of Balintawak,” \nwhich actually happened in Pugadlawin. \nFirst Skirmishes.—In the midst of this dramatic scene, some \nKatipuneros who had just arrived from Manila and Kalookan \nshouted: “Dong Andres! The civil guards are almost behind \nus and will reconnoiter the mountains.” Bonifacio at once \nordered his men to get ready for the expected attack of the \nSpaniards. Since they had inferior arms the rebels decided, \ninstead, to retreat. Under cover of darkness, the rebels marched \ntoward Pasong Tam6, and the following day, August 24, they \narrived at the yard of Melchora Aquino, known as Tandang Sora. \nIt was decided that all the rebels in the surrounding towns be \nnotified of the general attack on Manila on the night of August \n29,1896. \nAt ten in the morning of August 25, some women came \nrushing in and notified Bonifacio that the civil guards and some \ninfantrymen were coming. Soon after, a burst of fire came from \nthe approaching Spaniards. The rebels deployed and prepared \nfor the enemy. In the skirmish that followed, the rebels lost \ntwo men and the enemy one. Because of their inferior weapons, \nwhich consisted mostly of bolos and a few guns, the rebels decided \nto retreat. On the other hand, the Spaniards, finding themselves \ngreatly outnumbered, also decided to retreat. So both camps \nretreated and thus prevented a bloody encounter. This was the \nfirst skirmish fought in the struggle for national emancipation. \ni \nOn August 26, Spanish reinforcements were dispatched to \nPasong Tam6 to drive away the rebels. ‘But the latter, who were \ngoing to or were already in Balara, could not be found. The \nSpaniards, frustrated in their attempt to contact the Filipino \ncontingent, shot, instead, two innocent farmers who were leisurely \ngoing on their way home. Returning to Manila, the Spanish \nsoldiers boasted that a great fight had taken place at Pasong \nTamo and that they had driven the rebels to the interior. This \nwas the origin of the so-called “Cry of Balintawak”, which neither \nhappened on August 26 nor in Balintawak. \nMeanwhile, the rebels, skirting the mountain trails day and"

The following day, Bonifacio issued a manifesto inciting \nthe people to take up the Filipino cause and to get set for a \nconcerted attack on the Spaniards on August 29. The manifesto \nread: \nThis manifesto is for all of you. It is absolutely necessary \nfor us to stop at the earliest possible time the nameless oppressions \nbeing perpetrated on the sons of the people who are now suffering \nthe brutal punishment and tortures in jails, and because of this \nplease let all the brethren know that on Saturday, the revolution \nshall commence according to our agreement. For this purpose it \nis necessary for all towns to rise simultaneously and attack Manila \nat the same time. Anybody who obstructs this sacred ideal of the \npeople will be considered a traitor and an enemy, except if he is \nill or is not physically fit, in which case he shall be tried according \nto the regulation we have put in force. \nThe intended attack on Manila did not materialize, how¬ \never, probably because there were not sufficient arms with which \nto carry out the plan. Instead, Bonifacio and Jacinto led their \nmen in an attack on the powder magazine at San Juan del Monte \non August 30. The defending Spaniards, outnumbered and \nweak, fought a delaying battle until reinforcements could arrive. \nWith the arrival of fresh Spanish troops, Bonifacio and his men \nlost the battle and were driven back with heavy casualties. \nThe Revolution Spreads.—Meanwhile, south of Manila the \nrebels grew in strength. A thousand men marched toward Pasig \nand attacked the small force of civil guards. At almost the same \ntime, about 400 rebels attacked the church of Pandakan and \ncaptured it without any resistance, for the parish priest ran to \nthe belfry to save his life. Pateros, Tagig, Kalookan, Kawit, \nSan Francisco de Malabon (now General Trias), Noveleta, San \nPedro Makati, and other towns, rose as one man and pursued \nthe Spanish enemy. Bonifacio and his men shifted the rebel \nattack to San Mateo, Mariquina, and Montalban, which they \ncaptured but which were later re-captured by the Spaniards. \nWith the defeat of the Filipinos in the battle of Langka River, \nnear San Mateo, Bonifacio ordered them to retreat to Balara. \nThe Spaniards pursued them and in the battle that followed \nBonifacio nearly lost his life when a Spanish bullet ripped the \ncollar of his shirt while he was protecting his friend Jacinto."

Led by Mariano Llanera and accompanied by musi- \nkong bumbong (band with bamboo instruments), the rebels at¬ \ntacked furiously but were repulsed by the heroic defense of the \nSpaniards. \nThe Reign of Terror.-The flames that now engulfed many \nprovinces worried the Spanish authorities no end. To frighten \nthe population into submission, the authorities resorted to a \nreign of terror. Only by this means could they hope to prevent \nthe revolutionary movement from becoming national in scope. \nThe Spanish volunteers and Corps of Vigilantes promptly in¬ \nvaded the homes of Filipinos in order to secure evidence against \nthose who were directly or indirectly involved in the uprising. \nIn Trozo, Captain Carlos March of the Spanish Volunteers found \nincriminating evidence against Katipuneros. All suspects were \nimmediately arrested and thrown into jail. To localize the dis¬ \nturbance, Governor-General Ramon Blanco issued a decree on \nAugust 30 declaring the provinces of Manila, Cavite, Laguna, \nBatangas, Bulacan, Pampanga, Tarlac, and Nueva Ecija in a state \nof war and placing them under martial law. The decree further \nprovided that “any person accused of treachery and those against \nthe present form of government” would be handed over to the \nmilitary court for trial. Blanco, however, emphasized that “those \nwho would surrender to the Government within forty-eight \nhours after the publication of the decree” would not be turned \nover to the military court, except, of course, the leaders of the \nKatipunan. Taking advantage of this particular provision, some \nKatipuneros surrendered. Immediately they were forced at the \npoint of the bayonet to confess what they knew about the society \nand its members. Torture was employed to make them squeal, \nwith the result that those who could not stand the various tortures \ninflicted on them shouted the names of some Katipunan members. \nHundreds were arrested and jailed. Suspects in the provinces \nwere brought to Manila to receive what the Spaniards considered \ntheir “just punishments”. Heads of families, hundreds of them, \nwere shipped to the Carolines or to the Spanish penal colony \nin Africa. These men could congratulate themselves for not having \nbeen beheaded. Fort Santiago was so packed with Filipino \nsuspects that many of them died of suffocation.

Tortures were resorted to by the Spaniards in order \nto make the ignorant masses talk. One form of torture was \nto hang the suspect by the hands and then have him suddenly \ndropped to the ground. Another method was the use of an \nelectric machine whose wires were connected to the feet or \nhands of the suspect. The poor man was electrocuted time and \nagain to force him to shout the names of even innocent persons. \nAnother form of torture was to hang a suspect by the hand, \nhis feet barely touching the ground. More often, the suspects \nwere simply shot without any trial. On September 4, four Kati- \npuneros were executed at the Luneta. On September 12, thirteen \nmen from Cavite were executed. They have since been known \nas “Los Trece Martires de Cavite” The following month, the \nSpaniards executed an unknown number of Filipinos in Mindanao. \nOn January 4, 1897, twelve Bicolano rebels were executed, thus \nmaking them the “Twelve Bicol Martyrs”. In Kalibo, Kapis, \nnineteen patriots were shot to death. But the most infamous \ninjustice was perpetrated upon Jos£ ^izal, who was executed \nat the old Bagumbayan Field on December 30, 1896. These \nexecutions, however, only served to make the Filipinos more \nbitter and to fight with fiercer determination. \nThe Katipunan in Cavite.—Even before the outbreak of the \nrevolution, the Katipunan in Cavite was already divided into \ntwo factions representing two provincial councils. The factions \nwere known as the Magdalo and the Magdiwang. The former \nwas led by Baldomero Aguinaldo, with headquarters at Cavite \nel Viejo (now Kawit), and the latter by Mariano Alvarez, with \nheadquarters at Noveleta. The Katipuneros of Cavite were \nvery active, having raised the standard of revolt on August 31, \n1896 when they attacked the tribunal (municipal building) of \nSan Francisco de Malabon. The Magdiwang, on the other hand, \nattacked the Spaniards in Noveleta, shouting: “Panahon na! \nMabuhay ang Kalayaan/” (The time has come! Long live Lib¬ \nerty!) At Cavite el Viejo, the Magdalo, led by Candido Tirona, \ntook the offensive against the enemy garrison which was cap¬ \ntured without much difficulty. Meanwhile, Emilio Aguinaldo \nmarched against Bakood to intercept the Spanish forces coming \nfrom Manila but was defeated. Aguinaldo retreated to Imus \nand here, in the morning of September 5, he defeated the Spanish \ntroops under the command of General Aguirre.

Aguinaldo \nreturned to Imus the recognized hero of the hour. From that \ntime on, the Cavitenos called him General Miong, not Capitan \nMiong. \nThe rebel triumphs fired the imagination of the people. \nEvery male, young or old, carried a bolo or a knife, ready to \nfight the hated Spaniard wherever he was met. Aguinaldo was \nso inspired by the showing of the people and by the unity in \nall the ranks that he issued two manifestoes on October 31 calling \nupon the people to continue to fight until liberty was won. \nDefeated in many sectors, the Spaniards decided to carry \nthe fight to the province of Cavite. Governor-General Ramon \nBlanco, egged on by the friars and the Spanish populace, took \nthe offensive in Cavite early in November. He assaulted Bina- \nkayan and Noveleta, but was repulsed with heavy losses. The \nFilipinos, under Aguinaldo, also suffered losses, one of the \ncasualties being Candido Tirona, Aguinaldo’s bosom friend. \nHaving defeated the Spaniards, Aguinaldo and his men created \nthe positions of Secretary of State and Secretary of the Interior. \nJacinto Lumbreras was designated Secretary of State, while Daniel \nTirona was appointed Secretary of the Interior. \nThe successive defeats of the Spaniards led the friars to agitate \nagainst Governor-General Blanco. They accused him of dilly¬ \ndallying and of incompetence. Their efforts were rewarded \nwhen General Blanco was finally relieved as governor by the \nbrutal General Camilo de Polavieja on December 13, 1896. Po- \nlavieja began his campaigns in Cavite early in January 1897 and \npartially succeeded in driving away the rebels from several places. \nHis order to massacre the civilians led Andres Bonifacio, then in \nMorong, to issue a proclamation denouncing the Spanish brutality. \nInch by inch, the Spaniards captured the territory they had lost \nuntil about one-third of Cavite fell into their hands. \nBonifacio in Cavite.—The rivalry that existed between the \nMagdalo and the Magdiwang factions of the Katipunan in Ca¬ \nvite led to a series of reverses early in January 1897. In a mass \nmovement such as that of the revolution, unity was indispensable. \nTo patch up matters, the Magdiwang faction invited Andres \nBonifacio to intervene in the conflict. At first Bonifacio refused, \nsaying that his presence in Morong was necessary. But upon \nthe insistent request of Artemio Ricarte and Mariano Alvarez,"

Accompanied by his wife \nand his brothers Procopio and Ciriaco, Bonifacio went to Cavite \ntoward the end of December 1896. He was met at Zapote by \nEmilio Aguinaldo, Edilberto Evangelista, and a few other leaders, \nwho wanted to meet him personally. On December 31, an \nassembly of revolutionists was held at Imus to determine whether \nthe Katipunan should be superseded by another form of \ngovernment. The Magdalo faction believed that with the out¬ \nbreak of the revolution the Katipunan had ceased to be a secret \nsociety and should, therefore, be superseded by one more in \nkeeping with the demands of the period. The Magdiwang men, \non the other hand, contended that the Katipunan should remain \nthe government of the revolutionists because it already had a \nconstitution *nd by-laws recognized by all. The conflict was not \nresolved and the meeting ended without having accomplished \nanything. \nThe Tejeros Convention.-As months passed by and as the \nrebels found themselves on the receiving end of the armed power \nwith the Spaniards, their leaders thought it timely and wise to \ncall another meeting of both factions in order to solve their \ninternal problem. Consequently, on March 22, 1897, the two \nfactions again met at Tejeros, a barrio of San Francisco de \nMalabon. The conventic i was held at the estate-house of the \nfriars which the rebels had captured earlier. \nThe session opened at about two o’clock in the afternoon \nwith Jacinto Lumbreras a Magdiwang, as presiding officer, and \nTeodoro Gonzales, also a Magdiwang, as secretary. Severino \nde las Alas, a Magdiwang, took the floor and suggested that the \nconvention assembled should solve the problem of whether a new \ngovernment should be established to take the place of the Ka¬ \ntipunan. This suggestion led to one heated argument after an¬ \nother until both camps almost came to blows, numbreras sensed \nthe seriousness of the situation and immediately called for a \nrecess to cool off the hotheads. After an hour, the session was \nresumed with Bonifacio as chairman. To resolve the issue, he \nprudently acceded to the wish of some that a new government \nbe established to replace the Katipunan. However, he stated, \nthe principle that the will of the majority should be respected \nand obeyed must be followed.

We have in our pro¬ \nvince a lawyer, Jos£ del Rosario!” Bonifacio was hurt and felt \nthat he was insulted, for it had been previously agreed that who¬ \never got elected was to be respected. He demanded, therefore, \nthat Daniel Tirona retract what he said. But Tirona, instead \nof apologizing to Bonifacio, disappeared from the scene. Boni¬ \nfacio in his anger whipped his pistol and was about to fire at \nTirona when Ricarte held his arm, thus preventing what might \nhave been a tragic affair. The people began to leave the hall, \nand Bonifacio, still angry, cried aloud: “1, as chairman of this \nassembly, and as President of the Supreme Council of the Kati- \npunan, as all of you do not deny, declare this assembly dissolved, \nand I annul all that has been approved and resolved.” With \nthis statement, he left the hall, followed by his men. \nThe Second Meeting at Tejeros.—Aguinaldo, who was at \nPasong Santol, a barrio of Dasmarinas, was notified the fol¬ \nlowing day of his election to the Presidency.

Aguinaldo then acceded to his brother’s \nrequest and proceeded to Santa Cruz de Malabon (now Tanza), \nwhere he and the others elected the previous day, with the ex¬ \nception of Bonifacio, took their oath of office. \nMeanwhile, Bonifacio and his men, numbering forty-five, \nagain met at the estate-house of Tejeros on March 23.

At Naik, \nhe and his men drew up another document in which they resolved \nto establish a government independent of, and separate from, \nthat established at Tejeros. An army was to be organized “by \npersuasion or force” and a military commander of their own \nchoice was to take command of it. The document read: \nWe who sign these presents with our true names, all officers \nof the army who have met in convention headed by the Supreme \nChief [Bonifacio], on account of the critical situation of the pueblos \nand the war, having discovered the treason committed by certain \nofficers who have been sowing discord and conniving with the \nSpaniards, our enemies, corrupting the army and being guilty of \ncriminal neglect in the care of the wounded, have agreed to deliver \nthe people from this grave danger by the means hereinafter enu¬ \nmerated: \nFirst: All combatants shall, by persuasion or force, be incor¬ \nporated in an army corps and placed under the command of General \nPio del Pilar. \nSecond: We shall recognize no one as being vested with full \npower except Right in the first place, and those courageous officers \nwho, since the beginning of the war and until the present moment, \nhave never gone back on their oath and have conducted themselves \nloyally. \nr \nThird: Any disloyal person shall be punished on the spot, \naccording to his desserts. \nSuch is our agreement, and we swear before God and the \ncountry of our birth that we shall keep it unto the grave."

The Naik \nMilitary Agreement came to the knowledge of Aguinaldo and, \nrealizing the significance of Bonifacio's intentions, he ordered \nthe arrest of the Bonifacio brothers. A group of soldiers under \nthe command of Colonel Agapito Bonzon was dispatched to Lim¬ \nbon to effect the arrest. Bonzon ordered his men to surround \nthe perimeter of the zone of which Bonifacio’s house was the \ncenter. A skirmish was inevitable, and in the firing that fol¬ \nlowed Bonifacio was stabbed in the larynx, his brother Ciriaco \nwas killed, and his other brother Procopio was wounded.

In other words, the original decision \nof the Council of War stood. \nEarly on the morning of May 10, General Noriel ordered \nMajor Lazaro Makapagal to bring out the two brothers from \njail.

Aguinaldo, meanwhile, was in Talisay, Batangas, \nwhere he had established his headquarters. The enemy surrounded \nthe area in the hope of capturing him, but he slipped through \nthe Spanish cordon on June 10 and proceeded with his men \nto the hilly region of Morong (Rizal).

The effect of the decree was contrary to \nthe governor’s expectations, for the people continued fighting \nfor the Filipino cause. From his hideout, Aguinaldo issued a \nproclamation in July entitled “To the Brave Sons of the Philip¬ \npines” in which he listed the revolutionary demands, namely: \n(1) the expulsion of the friars and the return to the Filipinos \nof the lands they appropriated for themselves; (2) represenation \nin the Spanish Cortes; (3) freedom of the press and tolerance of \nall religious sects; (4) equal treatment and pay for Peninsular \nand Insular civil servants; (5) abolition of the power of the \ngovernment to banish citizens; and (6) legal equality for all \npersons. \nThis proclamation shows that Aguinaldo was still willing to \nreturn to the Spanish fold provided these demands were met. \nThis in spite of the fact that before July he and his men had \nalready established a republican government at Biyak-na-bat6, \nknown as the Biyak-na-bat6 Republic.

He \nwanted, he said, to stop the fatal conflict between the two peo¬ \nples, for he loved Spain and the Philippines. The governor-general \nacceded to his request. From August to December, Paterno \nnegotiated with Aguinaldo and Primo de Rivera on the conditions \nthat he thought would be satisfactory to both. On November 18, \nthe first document of what came to be known as the Truce of \nBiyak-na-bato was signed by Paterno as representative of the \nrevolutionists, and by Primo de Rivera for the Spanish Govern¬ \nment. Other matters were threshed out by Paterno, and on \nDecember 14 the second document known as the “Programme” \nwas signed by Pvu,erno and Primo de Rivera.

The \ngroup sailed for Hongkong the same day, December 27, with \nAguinaldo in possession of a check for P400,000. \nThe Failure of the Truce.—January 1898 was a month of \ncolorful festivities in Manila. The Spaniards, happy that their \nlives had been spared during the hectic battles, began a series \nof fiestas so lavish that thousands of pesos were spent to make \nthe occasion, that is, the end of the hostilities, a memorable \none. There were boat and horse races, fireworks in the evenings, \na magnificent ball at the Ayuntamiento or City Hall, and dramas \nat the Zorilla Theater. On January 23, the Te Deum was sung \nat the Manila Cathedral and on the 24th (Madrid time) at the \nPalacio Real in Madrid. \nMeanwhile, the Filipino generals left at Biyak-na-bato did \neverything in their power to surrender the arms given up by the \nrebels. Some of the Filipino leaders, however, were suspicious \nof Spanish aims and continued to hold on to their weapons. \nThey expected a continuation of the armed conflict and prepared \nthemselves and their men for the emergency. The Spanish au¬ \nthorities, on the other hand, did not trust the Filipinos. The \nresult was that periodic clashes occurred between the Filipinos \nand the Spaniards. The clashes started in mid-February and \ncontinued until Spanish power was destroyed by the combined \nFilipino-American forces a few months later. \nOne of the leaders, General Francisco Makabulos of Tarlac, \nestablished the Central Executive Committee which was intended \nto be a provisional one “until a general government of the Re¬ \npublic in these islands shall again be established.” This rebel \ngovernment had a constitution, popularly called the constitution \nof Makabulos, which provided for an executive committee com¬ \nposed of a President, a Vice-President, a Secretary of the Interior, \na Secretary of War, and a Secretary of the Treasury. It is clear \nthat the Filipino leaders were not disposed to follow the letter \nof the Truce, but on the contrary felt that they could use the \nmoney given to them by Primo de Rivera to purchase arms and \nammunition.

The Cuban revo¬ \nlution had drawn the United States to the side of the Cuban \nrebels, for American economic interests in the island were \nparamount. At that time, Theodore Roosevelt, Sr., one of the \ninfluential Americans, wi bed that war between Spain and the \nUnited States should break out in order to expand the navy. \nThis statement was made to his sister as early as May 1896. \nWhen he became Assistant Secretary of the Navy in 1897, he \nconceived the idea of attacking Manila in the event that war \nshould break out between the United States and Spain. To \nhis militarist mir i there was only one man who could carry \nout the plan. It was Commodore George Dewey. Taking ad¬ \nvantage of the retirement of the commander of the American \nAsiatic Squadron, Roosevelt worked for the appointment of \nCommodore Dewey, to the position. On February 25, 1898, \nRoosevelt cabled Dewey, now commander of the Squadron, to \nmake Hongkong his base of operations. At the same time, he \ninstructed Dewey to take offensive action against the Spanish \nflotilla based in Manila in case of a war with Spain. Thus, when \nthe war finally broke out, Dewey was in a position to rush \nimmediately to Manila to destroy the Spanish warships. The \ncoming of the Americans, therefore, was not a mere accident \nof the Spanish-American War, but a planned action. Roosevelt \nhimself made this clear when he confessed in 1899: “It has been \nsaid that it was a mere accident that Dewey happened to be in \ncommand of the Asiatic Squadron when the war broke out. \nThis is not the fact. He was sent to command it in the fall of \n1897 because. . . it was deemed wise to have there a man who \ncould go to Manila if necessary.” \nThe Spanish-American War.—In the face of the Philippine \nand Cuban revolutions, Spain could not antagonize the United \nStates. She therefore tried to heal the rift in order not to draw \nher into a fatal war with a rising powerful nation. Unfortunately, \nhowever, Spain’s Ambassador to the United States, Dupuy de \nLome, wrote a friend in Havana, Cuba, in January 1898, stating \nthat President William McKinley was a weakling and a low \npolitician. This letter was stolen and published in a New York \nperiodical. The result of its publication was that the Americans, \nwho had been roused to anger by stories of alleged Spanish \nbrutalities and mistreatment of American citizens in Cuba, \ndemanded war against Spain. The relief of the Spanish Ambassa¬ \ndor did not lessen the anger of the American public."

On February 15, 1898, the American warship Maine \nwas blown up at Havana harbor, resulting in the death of 246 \nmen. Roosevelt, seeing in his accident an excise to goad his \ngovernment to war, said: “I would give anything if President \nMcKinley would order the fleet to Havana harbor tomorrow. \nThe Maine was sunk by an act of treachery on the part of the \nSpaniards.” \nAt a little past noon, April 25, Dewey received a cable from \nSecretary of the Navy Long, saying: “War has commenced be¬ \ntween the United States and Spain. Proceed particularly against \nthe Spanish fleet. You must capture vessels or destroy. Use \nutmost endeavor.” Secretary Long’s cable to Dewey was off¬ \nshoot of the Teller Resolution which the American Congress \npassed on April 21, 1898, declaring a state of war with Spain. \nCongress passed a formal declaration of war on April 25. \nThe Battle of Manila Bay.—With the receipt of Secretary \nLong’s cable announcing the declaration of war with Spain, De¬ \nwey sailed from Mirs Bay, near Hongkong, for the Philippines \nwith seven heavily armed ships. In the early morning hours of \nMay 1, 1898, his fleet entered Manila Bay almost undetected by \nthe Spanish shore batteries on Corregidor and Bataan. Dewey \nsailed straight toward the Manila Bay shore in the hope that \nhe would find Admiral Patricio Montojo’s fleet there and give \nbattle immediately. The Spanish fleet, meanwhile, was near \nSangley Point, Cavite, waiting for the best opportunity to go \ninto the fray. In the dawn’s light Dewey saw the outlines of \nthe Spanish ships far to his back and immediately ordered his \nmen to turn back in the direction of Sangley Point. On the \nbridge of his flagship Olympia, Dewey calmly estimated the \ndistance between the two fleets and when he thought that his \nguns could hit the enemy ships effectively, he turned to the \ncaptain of the Olympia and said calmly: “You may fire when \nyou are ready, Gridley.” \nThe naval battle that followed was one-sided; in fact it was \na massacre. While it is true that the Spanish ships outnumbered \nthose of the Americans, the former were, nevertheless, poorly \narmed. All in all, the American fleet had more tonnage than \nthe Spanish flotilla. At 12:30 P.M., the destruction of Montojo’s \nfleet was complete. The Spaniards, in the face of absolute defeat, \nhoisted the white flag in Cavite in token of surrender."

With that single \nevent, the United States found herself enmeshed in the coils \nof world politics and signalized her entrance into the “Days of \nEmpire”. \nAguinaldo in Singapore.—As early as the middle of April \n1898, rumor filtered through Manila and the provinces that the \nSpanish-American war was a matter of days or perhaps a few \nweeks away. Many of the rebel leaders stopped their revolu¬ \ntionary activities pending the determination of the truth of the \nrumor. Meanwhile, in Hongkong, Aguinaldo and his compa¬ \nnions were following the trend of events on the other side of \nthe Pacific.

But there was a division in the ranks \nof the exiles, for Isabelo Artacho wanted the P400,000 given \nto Aguinaldo to be divided among them.

In the afternoon of his arrival, April \n23, Howard Bray, an Englishman of long residence in the Philip¬ \npines, contacted Aguinaldo and told him that the American \nconsul, E.

In the succeeding conferences \nwith Aguinaldo, Wildman suggested that upon his return to \nthe Philippines Aguinaldo should establish a dictatorial govern- \nment which was necessary in the prosecution of the war against \nSpain. However, Wildman said, after the war and after the peace \nhad been restored, Aguinaldo should establish a government \nsimilar to that of the United States. \nPreparatory to his return to the Philippines, Aguinaldo asked \nWildman to purchase arms and ammunition for the Filipinos. \nHe gave Wildman P50,000 for 2,000 rifles and 200,000 rounds \nof ammunition. Before his departure, he gave Wildman P67,000 \nfor another shipment of arms. With uncommon energy, Wild¬ \nman took charge of the purchase of the needed arms and \nammunition.

Once inside, Aguinaldo related his dealings \nwith Pratt and Wildman. Since the situation in the Philippines \nwas critical, Aguinaldo asked the members of the Junta to ad¬ \nvise him on what to do.

Aguinaldo handed them copies of his \nproclamations urging the people to rally once more to the Fili¬ \npino flag in the struggle against the Spaniards. \nThe news of his return spread throughout Central Luzon. \nA number of Filipino volunteers in the Spanish army defected \nto the Filipino forces. Aguinaldo ordered them to occupy Da- \nlahikan, the Cavite shipyard, to prevent the enemy from occupy¬ \ning it. Arms were secured from the captain of ■ the American \nwarship Petrel and distributed among the large number of Fili¬ \npinos coming in to offer their loyalty and services to Aguinaldo. \nOn May 21, assured that his people would not desert him, Agui¬ \nnaldo issued a proclamation, saying: \nEverything appears favorable for attaining independence. * * * \n* * * I urge that we strive to unite our efforts, and let us fire \nour hearts with the idea of vindicating our country. Many nations \nare on our side. \nOn the last day of the present month, at noon, we shall be \nable to rise all at once, and in case our enemies are aware of it, \nstart doing so openly.

By the end of May, Aguinaldo’s forces had \ncaptured about 5,000 prisoners. Imus, Paranaque, Bakood, and \nLas Pinas were captured from the enemy within a week. In \nPampanga, San Fernando and Macabebe were captured by the \nrebels, forcing the Spanish general, Monet, to run for his life. \nLaguna, Batangas, Bulakan, Nueva Ecija, Bataan, Tayabas \n(Quezon), and Camarines were up in arms and declared their \nloyalty to Aguinaldo. So sweeping were Filipino victories that \npractically the whole of Luzon, except the port cf Cavite and \nManila, were in rebel hands by June 1898. \nSpanish Attempts to Win Over Filipinos .“-The effect of \nAguinaldo’s return on the Spanish authorities was demoralizing. \nA few days after the event, Governor-General Basilio Augustin \nfound himself betrayed by the Filipino soldiers who volunteered \nto the Spanish army. To counteract its total effect on the Fili \npino civilians, some Spaniards, with the consent and, perhaps, \ninspiration of the governor-genera1 circulated a handbill en¬ \ntitled Viva la Autonomial in which they stated that the “salva¬ \ntion of the unity of the Islands, the unity of its liberties, and \nthe unity of its local and central government” lay with Spain. \nPedro A. Paterno, the negotiator of the Truce of Biyak-na-bato, \nwas behind this circulai, for he confessed at the time that he \nstill loved Spain and was hostile to the United States. On May \n28, General Augustin called the first and only Consultative \nAssembly and appoi ted prominent mestizos to sit in it. His \npurpose in calling the Consultative Assembly was to win over \nto his side the wealthy and influential segment of the Filipinos, \nnamely, the mestizos, and to make it appear that he had the \nwelfare of the Filipinos at heart. Actually, however, the Con¬ \nsultative Assembly was nothing but a decoration, for its function \nwas purely advisory and did not have the right to initiate reforms. \nAugustin’s attempts to win oyer the Filipinos to the side of Spain \nfailed. \nThe Siege of Manila. What was then known as the City \nof Manila was the Walled City or lntramuros. The districts out¬ \nside the City were called arrabales or suburbs.

Dewey had so far not \ninvaded or bombarded the city, where thousands of Spaniards \nhad sought refuge. Dewey thought that it was useless to conquer \nthe city by arms, for he did not have enough men to occupy it. \nHe waited for reinforcements from the United States. Mean¬ \nwhile, the Filipino forces under Aguinaldo besieged the city in \nan attempt to starve out the enemy within its walls. The suburbs, \nlike Tondo, Santa Cruz, San Juan del Monte, and as far north as \nKalookan, teemed with Filipino soldiers. To make the siege \neffective, Aguinaldo cut off the city’s food and water supply. \nSo effective was the strategy that the people inside the city — \nSpaniards, as well as Filipinos and aliens — suffered from hunger \nand thirst. It was only a matter of weeks before the Spanish \nauthorities would surrender to Aguinaldo. \nOn June 6, and again the following day, Aguinaldo offered \nGovernor-General Augustin honorable surrender. But Augustin, \nthinking more of Spanish honor than his life, stubbornly re¬ \nfused to accept surrender, for in the Spanish code of honor \nthe word surrender was non-existent. With this refusal, Aguinaldo \ncontinued the siege in the belief that hunger and thirst would \nfinally compel the governor to give up the struggle. \nThe Spanish-American Secret Agreement.—The first Amer¬ \nican reinforcements Dewey had been waiting for arrived on \nJune 30, 1898, under the command of General Thomas Ander¬ \nson. On July 17, the second reinforcements, headed by General \nFrancis V. Greene, arrived. With fresh troops, the Americans \nwere confident that they could easily dislodge the Spaniards \nfrom the city. Hope of an easy victory filled their hearts when \nthe third reinforcements, headed by General Arthur Mac-Arthur, \narrived on July 31. Preparation were immediately made for the \nbattle that would determine the fate of Manila. For several \nnights, some Spanish soldiers outside the city skirmished with \nthe Americans, resulting in a few casualties. \nMeanwhile, Dewey made use of his inborn diplomatic skill. \nHe thought that the surrender of Manila could be affected with¬ \nout the use of arms. Consequently, he started negotiations with \nAugustin, through the Belgian consul, Andre, regarding the \nsurrender of Manila. But when the Peninsular Government heard \nof Augustin’s plan to surrender, it relieved him as governor and \nappointed General Fermin Jaudenes in his stead. Jaudenes,"

To save face, he insisted that to satisfy the Spanish code \nof honor there should be a mock battle, after which the Spanish \narmed forces would surrender. He further insisted that the Fili¬ \npinos rebels should be excluded from participating in the \nsurrender of Manila, that is to say, they should not be allowed \nto enter the city. Dewey and Merritt accepted the terms even \nif it meant treachery to their ally, General Aguinaldo. Dewey \nwent so far as to promise to hold back the Filipino troops while \nthe mock battle was being enacted. This agreement between \nJaudenes, on one hand, and Dewey and Merritt, on the other, / \nwas so secret that no one else in either camp knew of its existence. \nBeginnings of the Filipino-American Rift.—At the time that \nDewey was waiting for reinforcements, Aguinaldo and his forces \nwere laying siege to Manila. This situation was favorable to \nthe Americans, for they did not have to be on the lookout for \nany hostile Spanish maneuver since the job of watchdog was \nbeing done by their Filipino allies. It was Dewey’s policy not \nto provoke an armed conflict with the Spaniards until after \nthe arrival of the reinforcements. When, finally, the latter \narrived, General Wesley Merritt decided that the offensive against \nManila should be conducted along the bay side. Since this \nposition was occupied by the Filipinos, he instructed General \nFrancis V. Greene to ask for Aguinaldo’s cooperation in the \ndrive against their common enemy. By “cooperation” Merritt \nmeant the evacuation of the bay side area by the Filipino troops \nso that the Americans could occupy it. Aguinaldo demanded \nthat the request for the evacuation be made in writing. Greene \npromised he would after the evacuation. With this verbal promise, \nAguinaldo withdrew his troops to give way to the Americans. \nGreene, however, did not honor his word. \nThe continuous stream of American reinforcements worried \nAguinaldo no end. He wondered why, in spite of the fact that \nthe Spaniards were then at the mercy of the Filipino troops, \nAmerican reinforcements continue to pour on in numbers. His \nsuspicions of ultimate American intentions, however, he kept to \nhimself. But other Filipino military leaders were harboring \nthe same suspicions. General Artemio Ricarte, for example, \nexpressed his doubts as to American intentions and warned \nAguinaldo “to be careful because it seems that the Americans, \nwant to fool us.” General Pfo del Pilar also unburdened him-"

So secure were they that on the eve of the mock assault \non Manila, General Anderson had the insolence to telegraph \nAguinaldo: “Do not let your troops enter Manila without per¬ \nmission from the American commander. On this side of the \nPasig River you will be under fire.” \nSuch an attitude served to increase Aguinaldo’s suspicions \nof American intentions. What began as a friendly alliance \nworsened into silent hostility. \nThe Mock Battle of Manila.—The assault on Manila was to \nhave begun on Augnst 10. Bad weather, however, delayed the \nplanned action. On August 7, Dewey and Merritt issued a joint \nultimatum to Jaudenes telling him to evacuate the non-comba¬ \ntants to safe places as the American land and naval forces would \nstart operations “against the defenses of Manila.” Jaudenes \nasked the opinion of high Spanish officials, including the Arch¬ \nbishop, on what to do.

There was a short display \nof fireworks on the side of the enemies. The Spaniards hoisted \nthe white flag of surrender at the southwest bastion of the walls \nat about 11:20 A.M., but it was not until 12:0C noon that General \nGreene noticed it.

He was on \nhis way to the Ayuntamiento to confer with General Jaudenes. \nMeanwhile, Admiral Dewey sent his flag lieutenant, Brumby, \na* his representative to the surrender negotiations. Merritt, on \nthe other hand, personally went to the Ayuntamiento to negotiate \nthe surrender of Manila. It was about five in the afternoon when \nthe terms of capitulation were agreed upon by both sides. By \nthe terms of the agreement, the Spanish authorities agreed to \nsurrender the Spanish troops and the Filipino volunteers found \ninside the Walled City. The Americans, on the other hand, agreed \nto safeguard the city, its inhabitants, its churches, and religious \nworship. The following day, Sunday, August 14, the document \ncontaining the terms of surrender was formally signed by the \nrepresentatives of both parties. \nThe Protocol of Peace.—Before the mock assault on Manila, \nSpain and the United States were negotiating for the cessation \nof hostilities. On August 10, Secretary of State Day submitted \nto the representative of Spain, Jules Cam bon, the French \nambassador to Washington, a draft of the protocol with pro¬ \nvided for the appointment of not more than five commissioners \non each side to discuss the peace treaty.

To show the capacity \nof the Filipinos for self-government, Aguinaldo established the \nDictatorial Government in May and, a month later, the Revo¬ \nlutionary Government. Different departments were created to \ntake charge of the multifarious duties of the new government. \nIn September the Congress was convoked at Malolos and a con¬ \nstitution prepared to guide the government in its progress to¬ \nward republicanism. Diplomatic agents were sent abroad to \nwork for the recognition of Philippine independence. But the \nUnited States, however, had decided to take over control of the \nPhilippines, and in December 1898 the Treaty of Paris between \nSpain and the United States was concluded. The treaty gave \nthe Philippines to the United States. Even so, the Filipino leaders \nproclaimed the Philippine Republic in Malolos with Aguinaldo \nas President. \nThe Dictatorial Government.—In the wake of his military \nvictories, Aguinaldo decided that it was time to establish a Fili¬ \npino government. He had with him when he arrived from Hong¬ \nkong a draft of a plan prepared by Mariano Ponce for the estab¬ \nlishment of a revolutionary government: Consul Wildman, how¬ \never, had advised Aguinaldo earlier to establish a dictatorial \ngovernment which later on could be the nucleus of a republican \ngovernment similar to that of the United States. Probably because \nthe critical times demanded a government with a strong executive, \nAmbrosio Rianzares Bautista, Aguinaldo’s adviser, told him to \nform a dictatorial government. Consequently, Aguinaldo made \nknown his intention of establishing such form of government \nwhen he announced, in the morning of May 24,1898, that he was \nassuming “command of all the troops in the struggle for the \nattainment of our lofty aspirations, inaugurating a dictatorial \ngovernment to be administered by decrees promulgated under \nmy sole responsibility. ...” Later iii the day, he issued a decree \nformally establishing the Dictatorial Government.

But there were times when, be¬ \ncause of hatred of the former masters, the Filipinos exceeded \ntheir enthusiasm and maltreated some Spaniards. Aguinaldo, \nwishing his people to follow the paths of righteousness and jus¬ \ntice, appealed to them to treat the Spanish prisoners humanely. \nOne of Aguinaldo’s first acts as Dictator was to issue a circular, \ndated May 29, 1898, urging the people to stop the disgraceful \ntreatment of the Spanish prisoners. He said: \nIt happens very often that the people and our soldiers, carried \noff by the triumph, forget all my previous advice in regard to the \ntreatment which they rught to accord to the prisoners, and, you \nwill enucavor to stop this disgraceful conduct toward the sur¬ \nrendered enemy, and to punish those who may disobey your orders. \nTo maintain peace and order and to suppress crimes, Agui¬ \nnaldo issued another order on June 1 providing that all classes \nof crimes were to be tried by competent military tribunals. Again \nand again, he impressed upon the people the necessity of respect¬ \ning the persons and property of the enemy. \nDeclaration of Independence—With a government in ope¬ \nration, Aguinaldo thought that it was necessary to declare the \nindependence of the Philippines. He believed that such a move \nwould inspire the people to fight more eagerly against the Span¬ \niards and at the same time lead the .foreign countries to recog¬ \nnize the independence of the country. Mabini, who had by now \nbeen made Aguinaldo’s unofficial adviser, objected. He based \nhis objection on the fact that it was more important to reorganize \nthe government in such a manner as to convince the foreign \npowers of the competence and stability of the new government \nthan to proclaim Philippine independence at such an early period. \nAguinaldo, however, stood his ground and won. \nOn June 5, Aguinaldo issued a decree setting aside June \n12 as the day for the proclamation of Philippine independence. \nAt the same time, he commissioned Julian Felipe, a composer"

Aguinaldo and other revolu¬ \ntionary leaders, upon hearing the composition played on the \npiano, adopted it as the official march of the Philippines. Agui¬ \nnaldo then requested Felipe to teach the music to the members \nof the band of San Francisco de Malabon so it could be played \nthe next day. Felipe changed the title of the march to Marcha \nNational Filipina (Philippine National March). \nOn June 12, between four and five in the afternoon, Agui¬ \nnaldo, in the presence of a huge crowd, proclaimed the inde¬ \npendence of the Philippines at Cavite el Viejo (Kawit). For \nthe first time, the Philippine National Flag, made in Hongkong \nby Mrs. Marcela Agoncillo, assisted by Lorenza Agoncillo and \nDelfina Herboza, was officially hoisted and the Philippine National \nMarch played in public. The Act of the Declaration of Inde¬ \npendence was prepared by Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista, who \nalso read it.

He was Apolinario Mabini. Bom of \nvery poor parents, Inocencio Mabini and Dionisia Maranan, \nin Talaga, Tanawan, Batangas, Mabini studied in a school in \nTanawan, then conducted by a certain Simplicio Avelino.

Tomas, where \nhe received his law degree in 1894. His dream to defend the \npoor led him to forsake the priesthood, which his mother want¬ \ned him to take.

Mabini, it must be noted, was not entirely free from \nnationalistic association, for he was a member of Rizal’s La \nLiga Filipina and worked secretly for the introduction of re¬ \nforms in the administration of the government. In 1898, while \nvacationing in Los Banos, Aguinaldo sent for him. It took hun¬ \ndred of men taking turns at carrying the hammock he was in \nto bring Mabini to Kawit. Aguinaldo, upon seeing Mabini’s \nphysical condition, thought that he mtist have made a mistake \nin calling for him to help him in his work. What could a man \nin such condition do to help him? But when Mabini spoke, \nAguinaldo’s doubts vanished. There was firmness in the sick \nman’s voice, and Aguinaldo decided to make him his trusted \nadviser. From then on, it was Mabini who stood behind Agui¬ \nnaldo. Envious enemies called him the “Dark Chamber of the \nPresident,” but his admirers considered him the “Brains of the \nRevolution.” \nReorganization of Local Government.—Because Mabini be¬ \nlieved in order, he prepared a decree for Aguinaldo’s signature. \nBelieving in the democratic principles, Mabini inserted in the \ndecree a statement to the effect that it was “the first duty of \nthe government to interpret faithfully the popular will.” Ma¬ \nbini wanted Aguinaldo to be surrounded by representatives \nclose to the people and who knew their needs so that the head \nof the State could take measures to meet those needs. Conse¬ \nquently, the Decree of June 18, 1898 provided for the reorgani¬ \nzation of local government in those provinces already freed \nfrom Spanish control. Made electors were those inhabitants \nwho were prominent for their high character and social posi¬ \ntion. These electors were to elect the town chief, the headman \nfor each barrio, and three delegates, namely, the delegate for \npolice and internal order, the delegate for justice and civil reg¬ \nistry, and the delegate for taxes and property.

The department secretaries were not responsible for \nthe decrees of the President, but they were to sign them “with \nthe President to give them authority.” The President appointed \nthe department secretaries and the personnel of each department. \nThe decree also provided for the creation of Congress. As \nhas been seen, the decree of June 18 provided for the election \nof delegates from each province to represent it in Congress. \nThe degree of June 23 provided that in those provinces which \nhad not been pacified, that is to say, provinces which had not \nbeen taken from the Spaniards, the delegates for said provinces \nwere to be appointed by the President. The powers of Congress \nwere defined as follows: \nTo watch over the general interest of the Philippine people, \nand the carrying out of the revolutionary laws; to discuss and \nvote upon said laws; to discuss and approve, prior to their ratifica¬ \ntion, treaties and loans; to examine and approve the accounts \npresented annually by the Secretary of Finance, as well as extra¬ \nordinary and other taxes which may be hereafter imposed. \nOn July 15, 1898, Aguinaldo macle his first cabinet appoint¬ \nments: Baldomero Aguinaldo, Secretary of War and Public Works; \nLeandro Ibarra, Secretary of the Interior; and Mariano Trias, \nSecretary of Finance. Cayetano Arellano was offered the \nsecretaryship of foreign affairs, but he declined, feigning illness, \nalthough actually he was in sympathy with the Americans and \nwould not, therefore, give his services to the Filipino government. \nLater, Mabini accepted the position and thereby became h member \nof the President’s official family. On September 28, Aguinaldo \nincreased the number of departments to six, namely, foreign \naffairs, war, interior, welfare, justice, and treasury."

He believed that in such \nperiod as the country was passing through it was necessary to \nhave a strong Executive. But his idea was contradicted by \nCongress when it proposed to draft a constitution. Congress \nadvanced the opinion that a modem constitution answering to \nthe needs of the times was imperative in order to secure the \nrecognition of Philippine independence by foreign powers. Ma¬ \nbini, on the other hand, argued that such a delicate task as the \nframing of the constitution should be done in a peaceful and \nquiet mood in order to give the framers sufficient time to deli¬ \nberate on the proposed provisions. At such a period as they \nwere undergoing, it was not proper to frame a constitution. \nMoreover, Mabini added that Congress was convoked not to \nframe a constitution, but to advise the President and to give him \npopular support. Mabini was, however, in the minority, and \nalthough his arguments were unassailable he was defeated by \nthe majority under the leadership of Patemo. Nevertheless, \nMabini submitted his Constitutional Plan of the Philippine \nRepublic, but Congress, for the second time, overruled him. \nA committee to draft the constitution was created, with Fe¬ \nlipe G. Calderon as its most prominent member. Having set \nMabini’s Constitutional Program aside, the committee, under the \ninfluence of Calderon, also set aside, but in a subtle manner, \nPatemo’s constitutional plan, which smelled strongly of the \nSpanish Constitution of 1869. With the advice of Cayetano \nArellano, a brilliant but unreconstructed mestizo, Calderon \ndrew up his plans for a constitution, deriving inspiration from the \nconstitutions of Mexico, Belgium, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Brazil, \nand France. In the session of October 8, Calderon presented \nthe draft of his constitution. Printed copies of it were made \non October 21, and discussions began on October 25. The most \ntumultuous discussions occurred when the provision making \nCatholicism the religion of the State came up for consideration. \nAfter much heated debates on the subject, the Congress voted \non it. The result was a tie. The second voting resulted in the \nvictory of the separation of the Church and State. The partisans"

The provision on the subject of state \nreligion was then amended to read: \nArticle 5. —The State recognizes the freedom and \nequality of all religions, as well as the separation of the \nChurch and State. \nA few other amendments were inserted in the draft constitu¬ \ntion before it was sent to Aguinaldo for approval. On January \n21, 1899, Aguinaldo promulgated what is now known as the \nMalolos Constitution. \nThe protracted discussions that characterized the Congress \nsessions on the subject of whether or not Church and State should \nbe united showed, first, that the Filipinos as a people, though \nup in arms against Catholic Spain, were not anti-Catholic but \nmerely anti-clerical, and second, that many of the delegates \nlearned from the bitter lesson of Philippine history in voting \nagainst the union of Church and State which, under Spain, was \nthe fundamental basis of Spanish colonial system. That decision \nbecame the cornerstone of Philippine democracy and showed \nnot only the nationalism and democratic orientation of those \nwho voted for the separation of Church and State, but also their \nkeen sense of history. \nThe Constitution—The Malolos Constitution is the first \nimportant Filipino document ever produced by the people’s re¬ \npresentatives. It is anchored in democratic traditions that ulti¬ \nmately had their roots on American soil. It created a Filipino \nState whose government was “popular, representative and re¬ \nsponsible” with three distinct branches — the executive, the le¬ \ngislative, and the judicial. The constitution specifically provid¬ \ned for safeguards against abuses and enumerated the national \nand individual rights not only of the Filipinos, but also of the \naliens. \nThe legislative powers were exercised by the Assembly of \nRepresentatives composed of delegates elected according to law. \nTo make the function of Congress continuous, the document pro¬ \nvided for a Permanent Commission which would sit as a law¬ \nmaking body when Congress was not in session.

The \nChief Justice of the Supreme Court was to be elected by the \nAssembly with the concurrence of the President and the Cabinet. \nThe Malolos Consituiion is unique for three reasons: first, \nbecause of the provisions making the Assembly or the legisla¬ \ntive branch superior to either the executive or the judicial branch; \nsecond, because it provided for a Permanent Commission to sit \nas a legislative body when the Assembly was not in session; and \nthird, because it established a unicameral legislature. Calderon’s \nargument for the omnipotence of the legislature was that he \nfeared the predominance of the ignorant military elements which \nwere solidly behind Aguinaldo. To counteract their ignorance, \nCalderon purposely provided for a strong legislative arm, so \nstrong that the executive, that is, Aguinaldo, would not be able \nto create an oligarchy composed of ignoramuses. Between an \noligarchy of ignorance, as Calderon called the men who fought \nthe enemy, and an oligarchy of intellect, he preferred the latter. \nTo check the executive further, Calderon made provision for \nthe creation of a Permanent Commission, composed of Assembly \ndelegates, which would sit as a legislative body when the Assembly \nwas not in session. Calderon’s purpose in including this provision \nis obvious enough: to check the powers of the executive even \nwhen the Assembly was in rececs. By this method, the executive \ncould not usurp the powers that could make him powerful \nenough to institute an “oligarchy of ignoramuses.” As to the \nunicameral legislature, Calderon pointed out that there was no \nconflict of interests among the people to justify the creation of \na bicameral legislature. Moreover, in a country like the Philippines \nwhich was then emerging from the formative stage, a bicameral \nlegislature might only lead to delay ip administrative efficiency. \nA third reason given was that there were not enough competent \nFilipinos to fill the seats of a bicameral legislature. \nThe Constitution as a whole is a monument to the capacity \nof the Filipinos to chart their own course along democratic \nlines. In a period of storm and stress, it symbolized the ideals \nof a people who had emerged from the Dark Ages into the light \nof Reason. \nThe Philippine Republic.—Owing to the objections of Mabini \nto some provisions of the constitution, Aguinaldo did not im¬ \nmediately promulgate it.

There was need for propaganda media to \nbroadcast these ideals and aspirations.

Privately-owned \nnewspapers took up the cause of the Filipinos and urged the \npeople to unite and to exert more efforts in the struggle for \nnational emancipation. Most famous of these periodicals was \nLa Independence, edited and partly owned by General Antonio \nLuna. Its first number came out on September 3, 1898. On \nthe staff of the newspaper were the great Filipino writers in \nSpanish, whose patriotic pieces were written under pen names: \nCecilio Apostol (Catullo), Jose Palma, Rafael Palma (Dapit \nHapon), Fernando Ma. Guerrero (Fulvio Gil), Epifanio de los \nSantos (G. Solon), .Jose G.

So nationalistic was the \nperiodical that the American authorities tried to suppress it, \nbut did not succeed. \nOther nationalistic newspapers were La Republica Filipina, \nfounded in Mandaluyong by Pedro A.

The University did not live long, for the \nconflict with the Americans led its faculty and students to disperse. \nDiplomatic Activities—In order to persuade the foreign \nPowers to recognize Philippine independence, Aguinaldo created \ndiplomatic positions abroad. The first step taken was the pro¬ \nmulgation of decrees creating committees abroad for the purpose \nof carrying on propaganda activities for the Revolutionary Govern¬ \nment. On June 24 and August 10, 1898, Aguinaldo issued two \ndecrees providing for the establishment of the Hongkong Junta \nwhose members were to represent the Philippines in different \ncountries. Subsequently, the diplomatic agents were appointed: \nFelipe Agoncillo, for the United States; Mariano Ponce and \nFaustino Lichauco, for Japan; Antonio Regidor, for England; \nJuan Lima and Pedro Roxas, for France; and Eriberto Zarcal, for \nAustralia. In France, the Paris Committee was established by the \nprominent Filipino residents of the city, and in Spain, the Madrid \nCommittee was founded with aims similar to those of the Paris \nCommittee, namely, to work for the recognition of Philippine \nindependence by the foreign Powers. \nAgoncillo, accompanied by his secretary Sixto Lopez, went \nto the United States to work for American recognition of Phil¬ \nippine independence, but his attempts to secure an official au¬ \ndience with President McKinley failed.

The \nAmerican commissioners were Cushman Davis, William P. Frye, \nWhitelaw Reid, George Gray, and William R. Day, who resigned \nas Secretary of State to become Chairman of the American Peace \nCommission. The Spanish commissioners were Eugenio Montero \nRfos, Chairman, and Buenaventura Abarzuza, Jose de Gamica, \nWenceslao Ramirez de Villa-Urrutia, and General Rafael Cerero, \nmembers. \nThe Peace Commission met in Paris from October to De¬ \ncember, 1898. Long discussions on legal points took place in \nwhich both sides refused to give in. Finally, the American com¬ \nmissioners served an ultimatum on the Spanish commission¬ \ners who believed that the Americans should be gracious and \ngallant in their hour of victory. But the American commis¬ \nsioners, having been instructed to demand the cession of the \nentire Philippines to the United States, were not in a mood to \nhumor their Spanish counterparts and insisted on their main \ndemand, that is, the cession of the Philippines to the United \nStates. Helpless, the Spanish commissioners finally agreed. On \nDecember 10, 1898, the Treaty of Paris was signed. It provided \nthat Spain would cede the Philippines to the United States in \nreturn for which she would receive $20,000,000 from the United \nStates as payment for improvements made in the colony. Fur¬ \nther, the United States agreed to give the Spaniards the right \nto ship commodities to the Philippines for a period of ten years \non the same terms as those of the United States. \nThe Treaty of Paris did not go into effect until after the \nAmerican Senate had ratified it. The proponents of ratification \ndid not command a majority in the Senate, for many senators \nbelieved that the treaty was unfair to the Filipinos. The un¬ \nfortunate rupture of Filipino-American hostilities on February \n4, 1899 led many opponents of ratification to vote affirmatively. \nThe vote was taken on February 6 and the treaty was ratified \nby two-thirds majority. American propaganda made it appear \nthat the Filipinos fired the first shots that led to the Filipino- \nAmerican hostilities. Consequently, the American senators who \nwere at first against the treaty now voted for it in the belief \nthat the Filipinos caused the rupture of Filipino-American rela¬ \ntions. The American propaganda, directed mainly by the instru¬ \nments of imperialists, won and thereafter the Philippines became \na territory of the United States. \nkl. 4K 4ft."

The misunderstandings that followed these \nincidents climaxed in the signing of the Treaty of Paris without \nconsultation with the Filipinos. Attempts, however, were made \nby a mixed commission of Filipinos and Americans to relax \nthe tension between the two peoples, but the American members \nof the commission tried to prolong the sessions without trying \nto improve the situation because they were waiting for the Amer¬ \nican reinforcements which were then on their way to Manila. \nFinally, on February 4, 1899, an American sentry shot a Filipino \nsoldier, resulting in the outbreak of the Filipino-American hos¬ \ntilities. The Filipinos fought at a disadvantage, for they had \nno sufficient arms with which to fight the enemy. But it took \nthe Americans almost three years to conquer the Filipinos. \nAmerican Apostasy.—It must be remembered that it was \nthe Americans who first approached Aguinaldo in Hongkong \nand in Singapore to persuade him to cooperate with Commo¬ \ndore Dewey in wresting the power from the Spaniards. While \nit may not be true that Dewey promised Aguinaldo American \nrecognition of Philippine independence, yet it is nevertheless \ntrue that there was an informal alliance between Dewey and \nAguinaldo — an alliance to fight a common enemy, the Span¬ \niards. There was, therefore, a moral as well as a legal basis for \nthe American authorities to treat Aguinaldo as an ally. And yet \nwhen the^ finally succeeded in increasing their number in the \nPhilippines and in agreeing secretly to the surrender of Manila, \nthey treated Aguinaldo as if he were . anl escaped convict.

Such American actua¬ \ntion showed that they used Aguinaldo merely as a tool for their \nown selfish purpose. More significantly, their attitude towards \nAguinaldo showed that they came to the Philippines not as a \nfriend, but as an enemy masking as a friend. \nIt was, therefore, not strange that Aguinaldo and his men \nlooked upon the Americans with suspicion. In such an atmos¬ \nphere all that could be expected was friction. When, in Decem¬ \nber 1898, the Treaty of Paris was signed without even consulting \nthe Filipino people and their representatives, the Filipino- \nAmerican alliance that was forged under the pressure of necessity \ngave way to mutual hostility. \nMcKinley’s “Benevolent Assimilation” Proclamation.—Before \nthe conclusion of the Treaty of Paris, President McKinley pretend¬ \ned not to know what to do with the Philippines. Actually, there \nwere American vested interests who pressured him into taking \nthe Philippines from Spain: the American economic interests \nwho were thinking of expanding American business in the Orient; \nthe naval and military interests who wanted the Philippines as \nthe first line of American defense; and the religious interests \nwho wanted the Philippines as a base of operations for American \nProtestant missionaries. McKinley could not ignore these vested \ninterests and so he finally instructed the American peace com¬ \nmissioners in Paris to demand the cession of the Philippines to \nthe United States. It is evident that from the outset the Amer¬ \nicans never really intended to help the Filipinos win their in¬ \ndependence from Spain, for had it been otherwise they would \nnot have sent successive reinforcements to the Philippines. \nWith the Treaty of Paris concluded to the satisfaction of \nthe American vested interests, McKinley issued his co-called \n“Benevolent Assimilation” Proclamation on December 21, 1898. \nThis proclamation was the first official indication of American \npolicy regarding the Philippines. It expressly indicated the in¬ \ntention of the United States to stay in the Philippines by exer¬ \ncising the right of sovereignty over the Filipinos. In other words, \nthe United States would assume control and disposition of the \ngovernment of the Philippines. At the same time, President \nMcKinley instructed his military commanders in the Philippines \nto extend American sovereignty over the entire country by force. \nGeneral El well Otis, who received the proclamation, sat on"

On January 5, Agui- \nnaldo issued a counter-proclamation in which he said partly: \nMy government cannot remain indifferent in view of such a \nviolent and aggressive seizure of a portion of its territory by a \nnation which arrogated to itself the title of champion of oppressed x \nnations. Thus it is that my government is disposed to open hosti¬ \nlities if the American troops attempt to take forcible possession \nof the Visayan islands.

He quietly strengthened the American observa¬ \ntion posts and alerted his troops. The tense atmosphere of the \nperiod was reflected in the evacuation of the Filipinos in and \naround Manila to safer places. On the other hand, Aguinaldo’s \nproclamations drew the masses together with a vigorous deter¬ \nmination to fight the ally turned enemy. \nAttempts to Relax the Tension.—Aguinaldo, however, tried \nhis best to relax the Filipino-American tension. He knew that \nan armed conflict with the Americans would necessitate more \nand bitter sacrifices on the part of the people and that not having \nsufficient arms and ammunition the Filipino troops would be a \nterrible disadvantage. Consequently, he wrote Otis on January \n9 notifying him of the appointment of Florentino Torres, Am¬ \nbrosia Flores, and Manuel Arguelles to meet with the same \nnumber of American commissioners. The purpose of the meeting \nof the commissioners was to work out a plan for the “adjustment \nof the conflicting political interests” of both parties. On the \nsame day, Otis appointed General R. P.

In reality, however, they \nwanted the conference to continue indefinitely pending the arrival \nof American reinforcements from the United States. The situation, \ntherefore, was this: since the American volunteers in Manila were \nnot enough to fight the Filipinos, it was necessary for the Amer¬ \nican commissioners to prolong the conference with the Filipino \ncommissioners in order to give the American reinforcements \ntime to arrive in the Philippines before hostilities could start. \nThe conference did not yield any tangible result.

Otis, who was \nsure of American victory, answered that the “fighting, having \nbegun, must go on to the grim end.” Aguinaldo then sent a \ntelegram to all local chiefs informing them of the start of the \nFilipino-American hostilities and ordering them to prepare the \npeople for any emergency. To determine the origin of the hos¬ \ntilities he ordered Felipe Buencamino, Sr. to start an investiga¬ \ntion. \nOn February 7, Buencamino asked Secretary of War Bal- \ndomero Aguinaldo for information regarding the incident. In¬ \nvestigations were conducted and witnesses called to testify on \nwhat they knew about the event. It appeared from the investi¬ \ngations that the senior military officers were not at their posts \non the night of February 4, but were in Malolos with Aguinaldo. \nIt was also learned that on February 2 and 3, the Filipino em¬ \nployees in American ships were dismissed from the service for \nno reason at all, and that in the morning of February 4 some \n200 to 300 American soldiers boarded two cascos in Manila and \nwere towed to Cavite. Upon their arrival here they were not \ndisembarked but sent back to Manila where they joined the \nother American contingents. The fact, too, that the American \nattack on the Filipino troops was sudden showed that the Amer¬ \nicans had planned the incident to force the issue against the \nFilipinos. \nOn the other hand, the American military authorities made \nno attempt to investigate the incident. Instead, they ordered \nan all-out attack against their former allies. \nAmerican Victories .—With swift strokes, the American army \nknifed through Pasig and other towns south of Manila. In the \nnorth, General MacArthur pushed ahead with his columns, \nbombarding the Filipino positions with accuracy. In the battle \nof La Loma, near the Chinese cemetery, Major Jose Torres Bugal- \nlon, one of the bravest officers, fell mortally wounded. With La \nLoma secure in his hands, MacArthur proceeded towards Kalo- \nokan, where General Antonio Luna was waiting for him.

Two days later, Luna’s \nforces reached Azcarraga, but the Americans fought back and \nrepulsed him with heavy losses. Luna then retreated to Polo \nwhere he established his headquarters. \nThe Drive to the North.-Tn late February and early March, \nAmerican reinforcements arrived from the United States, General \nOtis then began his intensive drive to the north and ordered \nGeneral Henry W. Lawton to take the offensive in the south. \nPolo was taken, followed by the town along the Manila-Dagupan \nRailway, until on March 30 the American army was knocking \nat the gates of Malolos. Meanwhile, the Aguinaldo government \nhad evacuated Malolos and established its headquarters in San \nIsidro, Nueva Ecija. \nMac Arthur wanted to pursue Aguinaldo, but Otis ordered \nhim to take a rest in Malolos. Meantime, General Lawton moved \nswiftly to the south, capturing Zapote, Bacoor, and Dasmarinas, \nall in Cavite. On the other hand, General Wheaton, aided by \ngunboats, successively captured Las Pinas and Paranaque, in \nMorong, and Santa Cruz, Paete, and other towns of Laguna. \nBut the Americans were not always victorious. On March 25, \nFilipino made a good account of themselves when they repulsed \nGeneral Wheaton at Polo and killed Colonel Egbert. In Quingua \n(Plaridel), on April 23, the American cavalry under Major Bell \nsuffered a defeat in the hands of General Gregorio del Pilar. \nIn this battle, the Americans suffered heavy casualties, including \nColonel Stotsenberg who was killed in battle. On December 18, \n1899, the Filipinos under General Licerio Geronimo routed the \nAmericans under General Lawton, who was killed in the battle \nof San Mateo. But these Filipino victories, however, were not \nsufficient to turn the tide against the Americans. The Filipino \ntroops were poorly trained, poorly armed, poorly fed, and had \nno discipline. \nAfter resting his men in Malolos, MacArthur now decided \nto march against Kalumpit. The Filipinos, under General Luna, \nwere in a good position to give battle to the enemy, for the \nAmericans had to cross creeks and rivers to dislodge the Filipino \ndefenders. Important to the Filipinos was the Bagbag River \nwhich afforded them good protection against the enemy.

At the precise moment when \nthe enemy was about to launch his attack, General Luna, irked \nby the insubordination of General Tomas Mascardo, left Kalum- \npit with his artillery, cavalry, and foot soldiers to punish Mas¬ \ncardo who was then in Pampanga. General Gregorio del Pilar \nwas left to defend the Filipino lines, but American superiority \nin strategy and arms proved too much for the “boy general.” \nWhen Luna returned to Kalumpit before nightfall, the Amer¬ \nicans had already succeeded in penetrating the Filipino defen¬ \nsive lines. Thus, the battle of Bagbag was lost and with it the \nother battles that followed. \nThe Fall of Mabini.—Mabini, as President of the Cabinet, \nwas the most powerful man behind Aguinaldo. When the United \nStates, through the Schurman Commission, announced the policy \nof the American Government of extending its sovereignty over \nthe Philippines, Mabini urged the Filipinos to continue the bitter \nstruggle for independence. In a manifesto dated at San Isidro, \nApril 15,1899, he said: \nAnd since war is the last resource that is left to us for the \nsalvation of our country and our own national honor, let us fight \nwhile a grain of strength is left us; let us acquit ourselves like men, \neven though the lot of the present generation is conflict and sacrifice. \nIt matters not whether we die in the midst or at the end of our most \npainful day’s work; the generations to come, praying over our \ntombs, will shed for us tears of love and gratitude, and not of bitter \nreproach. \nOn May 5, Secretary of State John Hay cabled the Schur¬ \nman Commission authorizing it to offer autonomy to the Fili¬ \npinos. Mabini stood for independence under the Protection of \nthe United States, but the prominent members of the Malolos \nGovernment, like Patemo and Buencamino, wavered and want¬ \ned to accept the American offer of autonomy. Believing more \nin autonomy than in independence under the circumstances, the \ninfluential members of the Filipino Assembly (formerly Con¬ \ngress) passed a resolution asking Aguinaldo to repudiate Ma- \nbini’s independence stand and to relieve him as President of \nthe Cabinet. Under this pressure, Aguinaldo, on May 7, 1899, \nwrote Mabini notifying him of the formation of a new Cabinet \nunder Patemo. The following day, Mabini answered Aguinaldo \ncongratulating him on his “wise political measure.” With Ma- \nbini’s resignation, the executive arm of the government was \nreorganized. Seven departments were created: foreign affairs,"

He was educated in Europe and studied a little \nof military science and tactics. But Nature endowed him with \nan unruly temper that made men fear and hate him. When the \nFilipino-American armed clash broke out, he saw the necessity \nof instilling discipline into the minds of the men, most of whom \nwere peasants or men of no training at all. His plan to recap¬ \nture Manila was brilliantly conceived, but lack of cooperation \nfrom the Kawit Company, who insisted that they took orders \nonly from General Aguinaldo, led to disastrous results. He re¬ \ncommended to Aguinaldo that the Kawit Company be disarmed \nfor military insubordination, but Aguinaldo did not follow his \nadvice. Luna, of course, disciplinarian that he was, resented \nAguinaldo’s partiality. \nIn several instances during the hostilities, Luna showed his \nterrible temper. He ordered that houses occupied by the Amer¬ \nicans be burned. At another time, he ordered the shooting of \ncivilians who violated military rules. More serious, however, was \nhis order to arrest the members of the Cabinet who disagreed \nwith him in political matters. He slapped Felipe Buencamino, Sr. \nand accused his son, Joaquin, of cowardice. Even Mabini, peaceful \nman that he was, complained against Luna and even suggested to \nAguinaldo that the tempestuous general be replaced. Luna, then, \nwon many enemies who may or may not have sound reasons to \nhate him. \nEarly in June 1899 when Luna was at Bayambang, Panga-"

One of the guards \nwas a member of Kawit Company whom Luna had earlier \nrecommended for punishment. He slapped the sentry and went \ndirectly upstairs. There he found Buencamino, whom he hated, \nand heated words were exchanged between the two. Luna wJfc \nreported to have insulted not only Buencamino but also Agui¬ \nnaldo, who earlier in the day had gone to San Isidro to inspect \nthe troops. A rifle report was heard and Lima rushed downstairs \nto upbraid the soldier who fired the shot. Near the stairs, a \ngroup of men belonging to the Kawit Company ganged up on \nhim. Some stabbed him with daggers, while others fired at him. \nLuna retreated to the street, whipped his pistol and fired, \nbut missed his target. Colonel Roman came to his succor, but \nhe, too, was mowed down. Luna fell on the convent yard, \nmuttering: “Cow. . . ards! As. . . sa. . .ssins!” He received no \nless than forty wounds. He was buried the next day with hon¬ \nors due his rank. But his assassins were never investigated; nor \nwere they punished for their high crime. \nAmerican Conquest of the Visayas.—Meanwhile, Otis in¬ \nstructed General Miller to attack Iloilo. Miller demanded the sur¬ \nrender of the city, but the Filipino patriots, headed by General \nMartin Delgado, refused and instead decided to fight. Fight¬ \ning against heavy odds, Delgado ordered the burning of the city \nto prevent the enemy from using it as a base of operations. On \nFebruary 20, Jaro fell into the hands of the Americans; Sta. \nBarbara fell on the 14th, Oton on the 19th, and Mandurriao \non the 20th. Having subdued Iloilo, Miller sent an American \nwarship to Cebu to demand its surrender. On February 22, \nCebu surrendered to the Americans, and Lt. Col. Thomas H. \nHamer was designated military governor of the province. \nThe occupation of Cebu was, however, not as peaceful as it \nseemed. The dissatisfied guerrillas murdered the Filipinos who \nsurrendered Cebu without a fight and harassed the American \nsoldiers by guerrilla tactics. The guerrilla leaders, Arcadio \nMaxilom and Leandro Fullon, threatened with death all those \nwho collaborated and would collaborate with the enemy. Thus, \nthe Americans had a hard time administering Cebu."

Otis, taking advantage of this unusual act of collabora¬ \ntion, granted them their request, but informed them that the \nisland would be placed under an American military governor. \nOn March 1, Otis issued an order providing for the creation of \na military district composed of Panay, Cebu, and Negros to be \nknown as the Visayan Military District. The Negrenses were \nallowed to meet in convention to frame their own constitution. \nThis the Negrenses obediently followed, and the so-called “Ne¬ \ngros Constitution’5 was submitted to the President of the United \nStates on July 20. Naturally, President McKinley did not take \nit seriously. Nevertheless, the constitution became the basis “to \nadminister its civil matters” under which the “people may enjoy \nthe largest measure of civil liberty compatible with prevailing \nconditions and which shall conform to their desire....” \nThe Bates Treaty—The Americans were very diplomatic \nand cheerful in dealing with the Muslims.

There was, therefore, \nno attempt on the part of the Americans to conquer the Muslims, \nfor they knew that they would have a big fight on their hands if \nthey made such an attempt. \nWith consummate skill, General Bates patiently negotiated \nwith the Sultan of Jolo.

After a protracted negotiation, \nGeneral Bates, representing the United States, and the Sultan, \nRaja Muda, Datu Attik, Datu Calbi, and Datu Joakanain, re¬ \npresenting Jolo, signed a treaty on August 20.

Not \nlong after the bloody incident, many army officers surrendered \nto the enemy, thus making it difficult for Aguinaldo to maintain \nhis army intact. General Otis, taking advantage of the confusion \nin the Filipino ranks, decided to trap Aguinaldo in Angeles, \nPampanga. He sent battle-seasoned troops to Lingayen Gulf to \ncut off Aguinaldo’s retreat. At the same time, he ordered Mac- \nArthur to force Aguinaldo to move north into the waiting arms \nof the American forces. \nThe American offensive began on October 12. Aguinaldo, \nfinding himself in a precarious situation, moved his capital to \nTarlac. When the enemy advanced he moved his capital to Ba- \nyombong, Nueva Vizcaya. The Americans were now in the \ndark as to the whereabouts of Aguinaldo, who had in the mean¬ \ntime transferred to Bayambang, Pangasinan.

It was a place difficult to approach, for the \nterrain was mountainous and all points leading to the town were \nguarded by Aguinaldo’s loyal men. \nThe Battle of Pasong Tirad.—In Aguinaldo’s flight to the \nnorth, his rear guard commander, General Gregorio del Pilar, \nnoted the advantageous terrain of Pasong Tirad. He, therefore, \nsuggested that in order to halt the Americans temporarily he \nwould stay behind and make a last stand at the Pass. He thought \nthat such a battle would necessarily delay the Americans and give \nAguinaldo, on the other hand, sufficient time to widen the \ndistance between him and the pursuing enemy. Aguinaldo ap¬ \nproved Del Pilar’s suggestion with much regret, for the young \nDel Pilar, the “boy general” of the armed forces, had been loyal \nto him. \nPasong Tirad was 4,500 feet high and commanded a good \nview for miles around. The trail leading to it was so narrow \nthat only one man at a time could clamber up the hill. Del Pilar \nordered his sixty men to b uld trenches on both shoulders of \nihe Pass where they could see the movement of the enemy below. \nAt ten o'clock on the night of December 1, 1899, Aguinaldo \nreceived Del Pilar’s report that the Americans had arrived at the \ntown of Concepcion. \nThe Americans under Major Marcn pursued Aguinaldo re¬ \nlentlessly, fox only the capture of the wily Filipino leader could \nend Filipino resistance to American rule.

In a matter \nof minutes, the Filipino defenders were overcome by the enemy. \nDel Pilar, woundea m the shoulder, ordered his remaining men \ntc escape. Then he strode to escape by a narrow trail, but as he \nmounted his white horse a Krrg rifle rang out through the mid¬ \nday air and felled him w'th a bullet that passed through the neck. \nThe Americans rushed headlong and captured the soldier holding \nthe reins of Del Pilar’s horse.

At the same \ntime, the Americans conducted an intensive campaign of pro¬ \npaganda to win over the Filipinos to their side. They used the \nmembers of the Filipino middle and upper classes — Cayetano \nArellano, Pedro A. Patemo, Felipe Buencamino, Trinidad H. \nPardo de Tavera, Benito Legarda, Gregorio Araneta, and others — \nto campaign for peaceful existence under the Americans.

The Filipino-American war was not an exception, \nparticularly because the combatants belonged to two different \nraces and civilizations. In judging Filipino brutality, however, \none must remember that the Filipinos, having been the victims \nof American apostasy and imperialistic designs disguised as “bene¬ \nvolent” and “altruistic”, have little to answer for their behavior \ntowards the Americans, for they considered the latter not only \nas traitors to their cause, but also as interlopers and an obstacle \nto their legitimate desire for freedom and independence. This \nis not to justify Filipino brutality committed as a defensive \nmeasure but simply to explain why the Filipinos had to be brutal \nto the Americans who came to the Philippines purportedly to help \nthem win their independence from Spain, but who actually had \nimperialistic designs on their country. \nThe sources for a knowledge of these brutalities came from \nFilipino participants and eye-witnesses and from the Americans \nthemselves who, in a moment of moral agony, divulged the de-"

The cruelty \nof some Americans came to the knowledge of the American public \nthrough articles and letters written by soldiers who had seen such \nbrutalities perpetrated upon the Filipinos. One such article appeared \nin Philadelphia, January 2, 1902, alleging that the American soldiers \nand their stooges, the Macabebe scouts, used the “water cure” \nalmost invariably to loosen the tongues of the hapless Filipinos \nin order to force them to reveal the movements, weapons, size, \nand methods of the guerrillas. The “cure” consisted in forcing a \nman to lie flat on his back, his mouth forced open by a stick or \nbayonet and, in some instances, a cartridge case. Then water, \nusually salty or dirty, was poured into his mouth until his stomach \nwas distended. The water was then disgorged from the stomach \nby making a chak of it for the soldiers to sit on. The process was \nrepeated until the victim shouted, “Hold, enough!” \nThere was variety in the mode of torture. Less common was \nthe Tope cure\" in which a long piece of rope was wrapped around \nthe neck and torso of the victim. A stick wa? placed between the \ncoils of rope and slowly twisted to give the effect of a garrote. \nSometimes, beating up a victim was resorted to until he became blue \nin the face. Two American officers, Lt. Alva Perkins and Capt. \nGeorge Brandle, were charged with and tried for “wilfully and \ncruelly causing six Filipinos to be hung by the neck for a period of \nten seconds, causing them to suffer* bodily pains.” They were \nfound gu^ty and reprimanded for their sadistic efforts. \nIn their desperation, the American soldiers turned arsonists \nburning whole towns in order to force the guerrillas to the \nopen.

Many American soldiers who \ngarrisoned the town were veterans of the Boxer Rebellion and \nhad participated in the capture of Peking. The American soldiers \nwere busy one morning taking their breakfast when suddenly \nthey were attacked by Filipinos in their employ. The church \nbells rang, and soon about 180 Filipinos fell upon the Americans \nmany of whom were killed instantly. The other Americans \nwho tried to escape were boloed tc death, while others were \nhacked from the nose to the throat. The news of the guerrilla \nattack gave rise to pained cries throughout the United States \nand so President Theodore Roosevelt gave orders to pacify Samar. \nAssigned to the task was General “Jake” Smith. “I want no \nprisoners,” he said firmly. “I wish you to km and burn; the more \nyou bum and kill the better it will please me.” Forthwith he \nordered that Samar be transformed into “a howling wilderness.” \nOrders were also issued to shoot down anybody capable of carry¬ \ning arms. By “capable of carrying arms,” General Smith meant \nto include even boys ten years old, for the latter could carry \nrifles and swing bolos. In six months, Balangiga became “a howl¬ \ning wilderness.” The barbarity with which General Smith sub¬ \ndued the people of Samar touched the conscience of the American \npeople. After the end of the bloody campaign, Smith was court- \nmartialed and retired from the service. \nAnother author, an American, said of American brutalities:2 \nLieutenant Bissell Thomas of the 35th Infantry was con¬ \nvicted of striking prisoners, one of whom was lying on the ground \nand bleeding from the mouth. The officer was reprimanded and \nfined three hundred dollars. Just before Mr. Root took office, \nRobert Collins of the Associated Press was permitted to cable: \n“There has been, according to Otis himself and the personal knowl¬ \nedge of everyone here, a perfect orgy of looting and wanton de¬ \nstruction of property.” Private Jones of the 11th Cavalry wrote that \nhis troop, upon encountering a wedding party, fired into the throng, \nkilling the bride and two men, and wounding ahother woman and \ntwo children. A captain and lieutenant of the 27 th Regiment were \ntried for hanging six Filipinos by their necks for ten seconds, \n“causing them to suffer great, bodily pain.” After the words were \nchanged to “mental anguish”, the officers were found guilty and \nsentenced to reprimands. \n2 Leon Wolff, Little Brown Brother (New York, Doubleday & Com¬ \npany, Inc., 1961), pp. 306 ff."

Noses and ears \nwere lopped off and the bleeding wounds seasoned with salt. In \nsome cases, American prisoners were buried alive. Kicking, slap¬ \nping, spitting at the faces of American prisoners were common, \nthe hatred of the Americans being such that the guerrillas forgot or \nconveniently forgot Aguinaldo’s injunctions regarding the good \ntreatment to be accorded the prisoners. \nThus the brutality of the conqueror or, as an old veteran \nof the Revolution called, the interloper, was matched by Filipino \nbrutality. \nEnd of the Resistance.—Though thousands of Filipino soldiers \nsurrendered as a result of the American peace propaganda and \ntheir brutal treatment of captured guerrillas, some military com¬ \nmanders refused to lay down their arms. General Miguel Malvar \ntook over the leadership of the Filipino Government or what \nremained of it and harassed the Americans by his guerrilla tactics. \nIn Samar, General Vicente Lukban resorted to ambushing Amer¬ \nican soldiers and withdrawing after killing and wounding them. \nAngered at this tactic, General Jacob Smith ordered the massacre \nof all men and children below ten years, with the result that the \nprovince became a “howling wilderness”.

When at the start of the second \nphase of the Revolution the Spanish archbishop enlisted Father \nGregorio Aglipay’s help in bringing back the Filipinos to the \nSpanish side, Aguinaldo persuaded Aglipay to divert his energies \nto the cause of the people. Mabini, riding on the crest of the \npopular nationalistic movement, suggested the founding of a \nFilipino National Church. Though unsuccessful owing to war \nconditions, his idea laid the groundwork of the later Philippine \nIndependent Church. The story of the birth of this Church is \nto a great extent the story of the struggle of the Filipino clergy \nto Filipinize the Catholic Church in the Philippines. \nGregorio Aglipay on the Scene.—The Revolution which began \nin 1896 was primarily a conflict of races. On the one hand were \nthe Filipino civil and clerical groups who were up in arms against \nthe Spanish civil and clerical segment, on the other. As it turned \nout, the second phase of the Revolution was not only political, \nbut religiouc as well. The Philippine Catholic Church, whose \nmajority belonged to the party of the oppressors, aided and \nabetted the colonial government in its policy of repression. Mabini \nhimself, in his letter to General Otis in 1898, accused the Spanish \nfriars of giving aid and comfort to the colonial administration \nand of taking up arms, when necessity arose, against the revolu¬ \ntionists. In the circumstances, he refused to free the friar- \nprisoners. \nIn the second phase of the Revolution, which commenced \nwith Aguinaido’s return from Hongkong, Governor-General \nBasilio Augustin and Archbishop Bernardino Nozaleda, know¬ \ning that Father Gregorio Aglipay was still sympathetic to Spain \nbut rather hostile to the United States, played a game in which \nAglipay was the pawn. They commissioned him to confer with \nrevolutionary leaders, particularly with Mariano Trias, Artemio \nRicarte, and Emiliano Riego de Dios, in order to bring them \n232"

Aglipay diu as he was told, but \nhis mission was a failure, for the revolutionary leaders had lost \ntheir faith in Spanish promises. Meanwhile, Aguinaldo, who \nhad just returned from Hongkong, sent Colonel Luciano San \nMiguel as his emissary to Aglipay for the purpose of persuading \nthe latter to work for the Filipino cause. Nozaleda countered \nby commissioning Aglipay to win over Aguinaldo to the Spanish \ncause. Aguinaldo, however, was firm in his determination to \ncooperate with the Americans and urged Aglipay to go to the \nnorth to work for the revolutionary cause. Nozaleda was well \nposted on these moves and, taking advantage of the situation, \nencouraged Aglipay to go north not to heed Aguinaldo’s prompt¬ \ning, but to investigate the condition of the bishopric of Nueva \nSegovia. Aglipay toured the northern provinces and secured the \nrelease of two Jesuit priests. Upon his return to Manila to report \nto Nozaleda, he found the city besieged on all sides. In the \ncircumstances, he did the next best thing: he went to Cavite and \njoined Aguinaldo’s movement. \nAt the instance of Mabini, the Revolutionary Government \nrecognized the validity of civil marriage on the assumption that \nthe revolution had made the separation of Church and State a \nreality. By “State” Mabini meant, of course, the Revolutionary \nGovernment, not the colonial government. Moreover, the Re¬ \nvolutionary Government, again at the instance of Mabini, re¬ \nfused to recognized Nozaleda’s authority and went so far as to \nprohibit any Filipino priest from accepting any responsibility \nfrom the Catholic Church or from occupying vacant parishes \nwithout the express approval of the Revolutionary Government. \nThe circumstances, then, were propitious for the rebel government \nto win the full cooperation of the Filipino clergy. On October 20, \n1898, Aguinaldo issued a decree ’appointing Aglipay Military \nVicar General. This appointment made Aglipay the religious \nleader of the revolutionary movement. \nNozaleda Against Aglipay.—Aglipay’s position in the Revo¬ \nlutionary Government as Military Vicar General and his position \nin the Catholic hierarchy as Ecclesiastical Governor of the Diocese \nof Nueva Segovia were anomalous. As a Filipino, he had to \nsupport the revolutionists, but as a Catholic priest he had to back \nup the head of the Church who, as a Spaniard, was naturally \nfor the colonial government. Aglipay chose to be a Filipino first \nand a Catholic second. On October 21, a day after his appoint-"

The letter also urged the \ncreation of a Cabildo or Council which would ask the Pope to \nappoint Filipinos in all Church positions from archbishop to the \nlowest parish priest. Realizing the chaotic condition into which the \nparishes had fallen owing to the capture of the Spanish friar- \ncurates, Aglipay, on October 22, issued a manifesto asking the \nFilipino clergy to organize themselves in such a way as to take \ncharge of all vacant parishes. This appeal was made to prevent \nfurther deterioration of the religious affairs of the country. As \nEcclesiastical Governor of Nueva Segovia, Aglipay urged the \npriests under his jurisdiction to rally to the revolutionary cause \nand to consolidate all the forces favorable to the cause of the \nFilipino clergy. \nNozaleda, deeply alarmed at Aglipay’s increasing popularity \nand the consolidation of his position as a factor favorable to \nthe Filipino clergy’s cause, decided to discipline the nationalistic \nFilipino priest. On April 29, 1899, Nozaleda charged Aglipay \nwith usurpation of power and urged the Ecclesiastical Tribunal \nto punish the Filipino priest. With the blessings of the Tribunal, \nNozaleda issued his decree excommunicating Aglipay. It was to \ntake effect on May 5, 1899. The decree of excommunication \ndeclared Aglipay a usurper and a schismatic. In an age of ob¬ \nscurantism, excommunication was the most potent weapon of \nthe prelates to force their enemies to their knees. It was ef¬ \nfective in Europe during the Middle Ages, and Nozaleda thought \nit would have the same effect on the Filipinos toward the close \nof the nineteenth century. And why not? Governor-General \nJuan de Vargas (1678-1684), though punished with less than \nexcommunication, was forced to stand at the entrance of the Ma¬ \nnila churches for a period of four months wearing a sackcloth \nand a rope about his neck. The effect on the governor’s person \nwas almost the same as if he were excommunicated: embarrass¬ \nment and humiliation. And so the Manila archbishop thought \nhe could humiliate Aglipay by excommunicating him. But he \nwas mistaken. Aglipay was a man of strong character and in¬ \nstead of cowering before the Spanish prelate to ask for forgive¬ \nness, he returned the compliment by declaring Nozaleda ex¬ \ncommunicated. Furthermore, he charged Nozaleda with starv¬ \ning the people and with collaborating with the Spaniards and \nthe Americans in the latter’s policy of repression.

On October 22, 1899, while vacationing in Rosales, \nPangasinan, Mabini directed a manifesto to the Filipino clergy \nurging them to organize a Filipino National Church. He said: \nLet the Filipino clergy show their zeal and love for the Church; \nlet them show their capacity to govern not only the parishes but \nalso the diocese; let them show that the regular orders are not \nneeded in the Philippines to maintain alive the faith in the Catholic \nreligion, and the Pope who cannot separate from justice as a Vicar \nof Christ who is God has to recognize the rights and merits of the \nFilipino priests. This is the most opportune occasion which Divine \nProvidence offers them to obtain the reparation of their grievances: \nthose who aspire to be something more than mere coadjutors and \npages must not let this occasion pass. \nMabini argued for the preservation of the Church, but its \npreservation must be predicated upon the appointment of Filipino \nclergy of all positions, high or low.

Aglipay stated the \naims in his speech, namely, the Filipinization of the Catholic \nChurch and the prevention of anarchy in religious matters. A \n“Provisional Constitution of the Filipino Church” was framed \nwhich outlined the composition of the Filipino Church. The \nnationalistic temper of the Filipino clergy was expressed in one \nof the canons which provided that recognition of foreign bishops \nwas forbidden, except under extraordinary circumstances. The \nConstitution in effect declared the independence of the Filipino \nclergy from Spanish control and supervision and the assumption \nof authority to negotiate with Rome. The wartime conditions"

The Filipinc Government was on the verge of \ncollapse and Aglipay himself was in the field fighting side by \nside with the Filipino guerrillas. \nChapelle and Filipinization.--Before the complete collapse \nof the underground movement against the United States, the \nApostolic Delegate to the Philippines, Mons. Pl£cido Chapelle, \nan American from New Orleans, arrived on January 2, 1900. \nHis first act was not to win over the Filipinos in general and \nthe clergy in particular, but to drive them away further from \nRome, on one hand, and from the Americans, on the other. \nThere was no mistaking the fact that he was pro-friar. From \nthe moment he set foot on Philippine soil he announced cockily \nthat he would tr< at those who opposed the friars and the re¬ \nsumption of their rule as enenres of religion and order. He in¬ \ntended, he said, i dominate the Filipino clergy by force, civil \nas well as ecclesiastical, for he was the Pope’s delegate and at \nthe same time an American. As an American, he presumed to \ncarry the author of the Government of the United States. \nA week after his arrival, he made it known that he would use \nforce on the Fill f no clergy to make it possible for the hated \nSpanish firars to return to their parishes. He made the bold \nassertion that the heads of the revolutionary leaders should be \ncut off. He insulted the Filipino clergy by stating categorically \nthat they were incompetent and, therefore, capable of holding \nonly menial pos t us in the Church. Such a profession of faith \nled the Filipinos — even the rabid Catholics among them — to \nhate him. It is possible that his open contempt for the Filipino \nclergy and the .revolutionary leaders led the former to close \nranks and to join without reservation the religious movement \nfor a Church independent of Rome. \nThe Schism. • napelle’s undiplomatic language and his re¬ \naction to Filipino aspirations, religious as well as political, may \nbe considered ora of the factors in the Philippine religious schism. \nIn the face of the new developments brought about by Chapelle’s \nreactionary attitude, the Filipino clergy, insulted and injured, \nnow agitated for a Filipino Church. In Rome, the Filipino \npriests, Salustiano Araullo and Jose Chanco, had an audience \nwith the Pope. They laid before His Holiness the problem of the \nFilipino clergy. But the pope was more inclined to listen to the \nfriars and consequently promised nothing. In Spain, meanwhile, \nIsabelo de los Reyes, a radical propagandist and scholar, wrote"

In July of the same year, he founded the first labor \nunion in Philippines: the Union Obrera Democrdtica (Democratic \nLabor Union). Its founding is significant, for it gave a broad basis \nto the religious movement to which the masses were favorably \ndisposed. On August 3, 1902, with anti-friar feeling swelling \nto dangerous proportions, Pascual H. Poblete a Filipino journalist \nand anti-friar, scheduled a mass meeting at the Zorilla Theater, \nthen located at the corner of Azc&rraga (now Claro M. Recto \nAvenue) and Evangelista streets. Poblete intended to attack \nthe friars in the meeting, but owing to bad weather the meeting \ndid not take place. That same night, however, lsabelo de los \nReyes called a meeting of h?s Democratic Labor Union at the \nCentro de Bellrs Artes and delivered a severely anti-friar speech. \nHe proposed the establishment of a Filipi.io Church independent \nof Rome with Aghpay as the Supreme Bishop.

These men, \nthough not hostile to the religious movement, were not prepared \nto lend their names to the new Church. Consequently, they \ndenied any connection with it. The most fatal blow came from \nAglipay himself who did not approve of the schism. He believed \nthat all means should be exhausted to come to an understanding \nwith Rome before taking any radical step. At that time, Aglipay \nwas conferring with the Jesuits."

The ground was now broken and \ntoward the end of the year fourteen Filipino priests affiliated \nwith the new Church. This was followed by the defection of \nFather Pedro Brilliantes of Ilocos Norte to the Filipino Church. \nHis influence seeped through the priests of his province and \nin no time, they, too, joined the new Church.

On the fifth \nday, Foradada handed Aglipay a document for his signature. \nThe document, apparently, was a confession of Catholic faith, a \nreturn to Catholicism and, in a way, a retraction of what he \nhad done.

But the American Pro¬ \ntestants were at the time enjoying the feeling of superiority to \nthe Filipino churchman and consequently did not do anything \nto help him.

With this failure, \nAglipay had no other alternative than to accept officially the \npost of Supreme Bishop of the Independent Church. \nIn September 1902, bishops were consecrated by the new \nChurch. Aglipay then accepted the position to which he was \nelected, and on October 1 he presided over the meeting of the \nCouncil which was to frame the constitution of the Filipino \nChurch.

As to the second basis, the Span¬ \niards had some justification in thinking the Filipinos were in¬ \ncompetent, for doubtless the early Filipino clergy were not rig¬ \norously trained for their duties. But the Filipino secular clergy \nof the second half of the nineteenth century were well trained \nand had all the earmarks of efficiency and competence in reli¬ \ngious matters.

In other words, \nby joining the Revolution which they thought would be success¬ \nful, the Filipino clergy wanted to take the place of the Spanish \nfriars and so become powerful not only in religious, but also \nin political matters. \nThe Spanish racial prejudice was so great that it was im¬ \npossible for the friars to overcome it. They considered the Fili¬ \npinos incapable of learning and so insisted on the perpetuation \nof the old regime under which the Filipino clergy remained \ntheir servants. Even in the face of military defeat, the friars \ncould not bring themselves to believe in the necessity of chang¬ \ning the status quo. It is for this reason that many of them handled \nthe Mausers and Remingtons when the tide of battle was going \nagainst the colonial government. They had to fight without \nshedding off their cassocks, for they were fighting for the con¬ \ntinuance of their power and authority in Philippine society. \nIt was this bull-headed refusal to accept the reality of changing \nconditions that was responsible for the alienation of the Filipino \nclergy from the Catholic Church in the Philippines. Aglipay \nexhausted all means to prevent a break with Rome, but the \nChurch authorities tried to divide the Filipinos by courting, \nflattering, and attempting to bribe Aglipay, the leader of the \nsecessionist movement, in the fond belief that, as in the past, \npromises of honor and lucre would tempt the leader into be¬ \ntraying the Filipino cause. Unfortunately for them, the na¬ \ntionalist movement had reached its apex and Aglipay, one of \nits mainstreams, was a man of integrity whose convictions were \nnot for sale. \nThe Revolution, then, had two results: first, the liquidation \nof the Spanish empire in the Orient, and second, the alienation \nof a segment of the population from the Catholic Church. What¬ \never the real motives of the Filipino clergy in joining hands with \nthe revolutionists, the fact remains that the religious schism, \nwhich led to the establishment of the Filipino Independent Church, \nwas the most important result of the Filipinos’ struggle for na¬ \ntional emancipation. The Revolution started as a political up¬ \nheaval; it ended as a religious triumph. The founding of the \nFilipino Church showed, finally, that the Filipino clergy had at \nlong last come of age. \n^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ \n*"

But to the \nFilipino masses, who looked upon their war against the Americans \nas a continuing struggle for independence, the resistance lasted \nlonger. The resistance can be conveniently seen in three sectoral \nperspectives: Christian, Muslim, and tribal. \nA. The Katipunan Inertia \nAs previously noted, the surrender of Aguinaldo only formally \nended the Aguinaldo-led resistance, but the inertia of the Katipu¬ \nnan revolution that began from the Bonifacio-initiated struggle \ncontinued to sustain the struggle for independence. In fact, \ndespite the Aguinaldo capture, the remaining leaders of the \nAguinaldo Army, particularly General Miguel Malvar in Batangas, \nGeneral Vicente Lukban in Samar, and other army officers, \ncontinued the war in their respective areas. That the resistance \nwas not dependent on the regular Filipino army was obvious from \nthe revolutionary activities of Macario Sakay after the surrender \nof Lukban and Malvar. Sakay, who attempted to put up his own \nTagalog Republic with its own constitution, kept alive the struggle \nfor independence even after he saw the lost cause of the Aguinaldo \nwar against imperialism. Sakay was eventually persuaded by \nDominador Gomez to yield but the masses who had looked up \nto him for the continuing resistance did not follow suit. \n1. In Luzon, 1905 \nResistance was reported by the American authorities con¬ \nfidentially and publicly in the strategic areas of Luzon, Visayas, \nand Mindanao. In Luzon in 1905, disturbances were reported in \nCavite and Batangas. Governor Shanks of Cavite noted outbreaks \nat San Pedro Tunasan, Paranaque, Taal, and San Francisco de \nMalabon.

By 1907, the mystification of the resistance \nhad expressed itself in a strong mass movement led by Salvador \nFelipe whose cause would be popularly known as the Santa \nIglesia movement, which means literally crusade of the “Holy \nChurch”. “Apo Ipe,” as Salvador was popularly known to the \nintimates of the movement, saw his cause spread to Bulacan, \nPampanga, and even beyond to Tarlac and Nueva Ecija so that \nthe weakening of the movement by 1910 might have found some \nkind of mass inertia against the colonial authorities in a shortlived \noutbreak in Nueva Ecija led by Simeon Mandac. Thereafter, no \nsignificant outbreaks were noted by the colonial authorities \nespecially after the change in American administration from Re¬ \npublican to Democratic in 1912. The policy of rapid Filipiniza- \ntion initiated by Governor General Francis Burton Harrison in \n1913 must have contributed to the Filipino elite’s successful \ncampaign to win the Filipino masses to the parliamentary struggle \nfor self-government which was encouraged by the American \ngovernment. \n2. In Bicol, 1902 \nIn the Bicol Peninsula and the Visayas, the pattern of resistance \nshowed a radical shift from the elite to the masses. One of the \nmovements that worried the Am?ricans was the one led by Simeon \nOla and about 1,500 “insurrectos” in Albay. As a charismatic \nlocal leader, Ola started his activities after the fall of Aguinaldo. \nNo less than Col. Harry H. Bandholtz noted the significant role \nof °la in the anti-colonial resistance in Bicol, although he regarded \nOla as nothing but a notorious ladron. \nThe American answer to Ola’s movement was a reconcentra¬ \ntion system in March 1903 which continued up to October. The \neffect was telling on the people who were brought into the re¬ \nconcentration area. Food and accommodation were inadequate \nand deplorable. Diseases took their death toll and sufferings \ncontinued. Although no statistical record was kept of the extent \nof the damage to the people, the scanty reports that came from \nprivate sources and field correspondents of the U.S. Senate in¬ \ndicated the innumerable deaths inflicted on the helpless by the \nsystem. The method worked effectively for American purposes. \nAbout 300,000 was the estimated total casualties of the re¬ \nconcentration system. But Governor Taft justified the method \nbecause a “reign of terror” had been inaugurated by Ola in the \nprovince and other areas."

Vice Governor Luke Wright and Dr. \nPardo de Tavera went to Albay to appeal to the people to help \nbring Ola to surrender to avoid deployment of the U.S. Army. \nMany conferences and promises were made and after forty days \nof tedious negotiations, Ola suspended the negotiations and \nwithdrew his forces. He also took along a number of new recruits \nfor his movement whom he had gained during the cessation of \nhostilities. On September 22, 1903, Colonel Bandholtz signed an \nagreement with Ola promising the latter immunity and “other \nthings”. Later, the authorities denied promising Ola anything. \nThey propagated the view that Ola finally surrendered in late \nOctober because he felt it was better than the prospect of con¬ \nfronting the U.S. troops that would be ordered to get him and \nhis men. Reportedly, he was joined in his surrender by about \n500 to 600 of his followers. \nOla turned state witness against those who had joined him. \nThis was the view spread out by the authorities. Accordingly, in \nreturn for his cooperation, Ola obtained executive clemency in \nline with the judicial practice in the West. In November the \ntrial of the accused began with Judge James Blount and Judge \nAdam C. Carson presiding. They were assisted by Chief Prosecutor \nJames Ross. Several of Ola’s men were freed. Some were sentenced \nunder the Vagrancy Law while others were tried under the Sedition \nLaw of 1901. The more serious cases were disposed of under the \nBrigandage Act which carried the death penalty. As for Ola, \nhe was given instead thirty years in prison for turning state witness. \n3. In the Visayas, 1902 \nOther areas that presented a serious challenge to American \ncolonial capacity were Samar and Leyte. The outbreak of dis¬ \nturbances was particularly irksome after the surrender of General \nLukban in Samar in 1902. It continued up to the end of 1906. \nThe inertia of the revolutionary struggle did not end with Lukban’s \ncapitulation. As noted by the Americans, Samar saw during \nthis time the appearance of numerous bands with diverse purposes. \nSome were preying on people with cattle, properties, and things \njust as others were continuing the political unrest. These “jet¬ \nsams” and “flotsams,” as the Americans called them, were profes¬ \nsional in their work. They created the popular image of liberators \nand benefactors of the oppressed and the poor.

One of the serious \nincidents took place on July 10, 1904 and was known as the \n“Tauiran Affair”. It was a raid by one of the bands on the village \nof Tauiran in the town of Gandara. One hundred houses were \nburned and 21 people killed. This was followed by the “Cantaguic \nAffair” in which the police lieutenant of the town and others \nwere killed. After the killing, the raiders under their leader, Juliano \nCaducoy, proceeded to the tribunal or town hall where the local \nteniente was seized and around his head the American flag was \ntied. Kerosene was poured on him and he was taken out into \nthe public square. Here the raiders burned the flag and the \nteniente. Caducoy warned the people that the same fate awaited \nthose who served the flag. Then the raiders cut off the teniente’s \nlips, burned the barrio and took away, fifty captives. The teniente \nlater died. Caducoy was subsequently captured and hanged. \nIt should be noted that several towns had the same fate \nas Tauiran and Cantaguic. Thirteen towns in Gandara, eleven in \nCatbalogan, seven in Wright, three in Catubig, eight in Borongan, \nseven in Taft, and three in Llorente were put to the torch by the \npulahanes the name given to the insurrectors. The disturbances \nin Samar were followed in 1905 by similar outbreaks in Negros, \nPanay, Cebu, and Leyte. When Vice-Governor Henry C. Ide \nbecame Acting Governor General on November 4, 1905, he \nordered Governor Curry of Samar to solve the problem. Curry \nadmitted that by 1906 the situation had not been changed and \nthousands of people had joined the pulahan movement. He began \nnegotiations for surrender. After several weeks, reported Col. \nWalace Taylor, Curry and the pulahanes reached an agreement in \nwhich the latter were to yield on March 24, 1906. Instead of \nsurrender, 30 pulahanes under Nasario Aguilar attacked the Consta¬ \nbulary garrison of 50 men. In hand to hand combat, 35 pulahanes \ndied in the garrison and 8 more outside. On the colonial side, 22 \nwere killed, 7 were wounded, including Captain Jones and Lieu¬ \ntenant Bowers. \nAs a result of the “Magtaon incident*” an inquiry revealed \nthat the pulahanes suspected bad faith when they saw present \ncertain native officials and natives they hated in the supposed \nsurrender. The authorities deployed 7 companies of native scouts \nand 4 companies of American troops under Colonel Smith of the \n8th Infantry to the Samar campaigns. This was in addition to the \n21st U.S. Infantry."

In one \nof the engagements, 450 natives confronted the Constabulary \nand the 21st Infantry. In the encounter, 59 of the insurrectos \ndied. / \nWhy the Filipinos had not abandoned the armed resistance \nto American rule, notwithstanding the American declaration that \npeace had been established by 1907, was due to the continuing \nracial hatred that existed between the Filipinos and the Amer¬ \nicans. Governor James Smith admitted in his 1909 report: “an \nera of ill feeling has started between Americans and Filipinos and \nI hesitate to say it, race hatred.” \n4. In Mindanao, 1903 \nArmed disturbances, which assumed the nature of anti-colonial \nresistance, were also noted in Mindanao. In March 1903, this \nkind of situation was recorded in Surigao. Civil Governor William \nHoward Taft reported that a group of “outlaws” entered the \ntown of Surigao on March 23 and attacked the Constabulary \nstation which was under the charge of Captain Clark.

Kelly, \nthe provincial treasurer, into a government stonehouse. Kelly, the \nIndian scout of Yellowstone, held the attackers at bay until \nreinforcement arrived. Governor Taft was criticized for his \ncasual treatment of the incident and for the sad state of the \nConstabulary as a force entrusted with the internal security of \nthe town. As a step to neutralize this criticism, Taft ordered \nthe army to retrieve the 75 or more guns taken by the band. \nThose who were captured were tried by District Judge, James \nBlount, for about a month, during which time he was protected \nby 703 soldiers under Colonel Meyer of the 11th Infantry.

They were not bandits or “cut¬ \nthroats,” as admitted by the American authorities. Although \nnot as widespread as the revolutionary resistance in Luzon or \nVisayas, the Misamis insurrectos had the respect and support of \nthe people because their aim was to resist the colonial government \nin the region. \nB. The Muslim Struggle \nEven before the fall of Aguinaldo, sporadic clashes between \nMuslims and American troops started in Moroland. It was part \nof American colonial policy not to provoke the Muslims to violent \nreaction while the American war against Aguinaldo’s armed forces \nwas going on. The signing of the Bates Treaty on August 20, \n1899 was part of this colonial strategy to neutralize the Sulu \nMuslims who were spoiling for battle against the Americans. \nBy 1902, the Americans had reduced the Filipino resistance to \nsmall guerrilla-type attacks on American stations. This allowed \nAmerican attention to be focused on the “Moro Problem”. \nBut American imperialist approach to the Muslim problem, \nwhile anchored on a decisive millitary response, included a subtle \nuse of non-military means to create a positive impression of \nAmerican intention. Thus, in 1903, the “Moro Province” was \norganized to reconstitute the administrative processes in Mindanao \nin order to show democracy at work but with American control \nremaining dominant. A year after, in 1904, with the successful \ninauguration of the Moro Province with Gen. Leonardo Wood \nas its first governor, the Bates Treaty was unilaterally abrogated \nby the United States. While the reason for abrogation given by the \nauthorities, including President William H. Taft, was the failure \nor ineffectiveness of the Sultan to control the Moros. the actual \nreason was the need to cut at the outset any political postur¬ \ning or leverage the Sultanate had acquired against American \nsovereignty or supremacy under the Bates Treaty. In this regard, \nTaft said that with the abrogation of the treaty, the Sultanate \nwas left with no other option but to resist the imperialist deter¬ \nmination to emasculate the Sultan and, consequently, to destroy \nthe political hold of the Sultanate over its subjects. The armed \nresistance after 1903 had acquired an ominous nature and pattern \nin the archipelago and, in a sense, would have some relation to \nthe Muslim resistance in Lanao and Cotabato.

The Lanao Resistance, 1902-1912. Despite American \nefforts to neutralize the Maranao leadership, only a part of it \nwas amenable to accepting American sovereignty. The other \npart that continued the “Moro resistance” to colonialism was \nrepresented by traditional leaders like Sajiduciman, Ampuanagus, \nand Datu Grande. In June 1902, Datu Tungul of Onayan attacked \nCamp Vicars. The Sultan of Binidayan was suspected by Amer¬ \nican authorities as being involved in the Tungul affair. He was \narrested, but ran amuck when he failed to convince the Americans \nof his innocence. His death triggered unrest among the Lanao \nMuslims. In Maciu, 150 to 200 Muslims, led by Sultan Ganduli \nand Sultan Tanagan, fought furiously against the Americans. \nOnly three Muslims escaped and one American soldier was serious¬ \nly wounded. \nIn Taraca, in May 1903, John Pershing started his campaign \nagainst the Lake Moros. Although there were datus who co¬ \noperated, Datu Ampuanagus eluded American troops, but in \none engagement at Pitacus, 13 Muslims were wounded, 23 were \ncaptured, and 90 were killed. Ampuanagus, with over 200 follow¬ \ners, took a last stand at his Taraca fort. The American assault \nresulted in the destruction of the fort, with 200 defenders killed \nand 29 captured, including Ampuanagus. In 1906, he again defied \nthe Americans. Troops from Camp Keithley were sent in pursuit \nof Ampuanagus, but they were ambushed. Only three of the \ntroops and a Muslim guide were wounded. Again troops were \nfielded to Ramain where Ampuanagus was reported hiding. \nThere were clashes but no reported casualties. Finally, in June \n1907, military contingents engaged Ampuanagus and his band \nat Didaganan, inflicting heavy casualties on the latter. In 1908, \nhe attacked Dansalan with 20 rifles and harrassed government \ntroops in surrounding areas. Finally, peace negotiations led to \nAmpuanagus surrender, thus ending the resistance of one of the \nmost elusive Lanao rebel leaders during the early American \ndecade. With the neutralization of Ampuanagus’ resistance, \nthe Lanao problem had virtually been solved. There were no \nsignificant encounters or battles after Ampuanagus. The other \nLanao datus and sultans had earlier accepted the American peace \noverture and offer of political partnership in local administration."

The Bates Treaty, 1899 \nAfter the cession of the Philippines by Spair to the United \nStates in 1898, the Sulu Muslims, like the rest of the Filipinos, \nhad remained unreconciled to colonial rule. The serious conflict \nbetween Sulu and Spain in late 19th century had not resulted \nin the weakening of Muslim will to remain free. But the United \nStates was determined to enforce its so-called sovereignty over \nall of Moroland. The problem was . how to contain for a while \nMuslim resistance while American forces were busy eliminating the \nFilipino obstacle in Luzon and the Visayas. Thus, the Bates Treaty \nwas concluded with the Sulu Sultanate, the first such formal \nagreement entered into by the United States with the Muslims. \nAs already intimated, the American government had no intention \nof recognizing Muslim sovereignty in Moroland. The Muslims \nwere aware of this American design. That is why the Bates Treaty \nwas not binding on those who continued to resist, especially those \nwho opposed the Sultan. There was Datu Julkanain and Datu \nKalbi of Patikul who refused to join the Sultan. Then Panglima \nHassan defied American threat when he showed non-compliance \nwith the American demand of at least nominal recognition. The \n“Hassan Uprising” disrupted the stability of the Moro Province \nrule in Sulu. The Americans used the rebellion to discredit the \nSultanate and to abrogate the Bates Treaty.

Before long Hassan \nand two other companions emerged from the crater where they \nhad hidden for their morning personal routine. They were spotted \nby American sharpshooters who felled two of Hassan’s com¬ \npanions. But Hassan was unhurt and immediately slipped back to \nhis hideout. Meanwhile the encircling troops inched their way \nuntil all possible exits of Hassan were sealed. Then, a sergeant \nsuddenly met Hassan who was trying to crawl out from the crater. \nThe sergeant positioned himself with a calvin to put an end \nto the Hassan episode. Realizing the inevitable moment had come \nand possibilities of another escape was nil, Hassan took his \n“barung” — the weapon he had perfectly mastered since he saw \nthe first glimpse of conflict. He plunged at the soldier who tried \nto get at him, but the bullets from the sergeant’s calvin finally \nended the career of Sulu’s most colorful leader from the masses. \nWhen Hassan’s body was examined, there were twenty-six bullet \nwounds sustained from several encounters. \nHassan’s death did no!; end the Sulu resistance.

Bud Dqjo, 1906 \nIn 1906, shortly after the suppression of the Pala Uprising, \nanother trouble was brewing as hundreds of Muslims trekked \ntowards the crater of an extinct volcano, Bud Dajo, located \nstrategically in the northern series of mountain ranges which had \nfigured prominently in past encounters. The uneasiness was \ncaused by a rumor that American intention was to wipe out the \nJolo Muslims. Thus, the trek to Bud Dajo was to become a heroic \nstand against American rule. Although the American authorities \ndenied the truth of the rumor, it was too late to turn back the \ntide of a popular feeling that was aggravated by worsening social \nand economic problems. To confront the Muslims was a relatively \nsmall contingent of American troops composed of 65 men from \nthe 6th Infantry, 65 men from the 4th Cavalry, and 130 soldiers \nfrom the 28th Mountain Battery. \nBud Dajo was formidable and strategic. Three small tracks, two \nfeet wide, led to the crater measuring about 15 acres. The crater \nhad abundant fresh water and was stocked with food resources. \nGovernor Leonard Wood, who was dealing personally with the \nproblem, admitted that the campaign was difficult because of the \nnatural difficulties created by the geographic character of the \narea. Muslim barricades of not more than 8 feet along lava ridges \nand steep precipices would make “fall offs” land on top of trees \nbelow. Wood’s strategy was, therefore, to avoid such a hazardous \noperation by appealing to the defenders to surrender while at the \nsame time preparing the military force. \nGovernor Wood took immediate steps in line with the strategy. \nCol. Hugh W. Scott of the Zamboanga Constabulary and Captain \nJohn White were ordered to proceed to Jolo with 50 men. Then \nprominent leaders of Patikul were tapped as peace emissaries — \nDatu Kalbi, Datu Julkanain, and Panglima Bandahala. For two \ndays the emissaries tried to persuade the defenders to abandon \ntheir resistance. On the third day the emissaries returned to Jolo \nto report the sad news of their futile mission. Sulu Governor \nScott ordered the immediate assault on Dajo. The battle began on \nMarch 5, 1906 and lasted up to the morning of March 8. Colonel \nDuncan was placed in command of the entire operation. Governor \nWood gave a last chance for non-combatants to be evacuated but \nthe latter refused. They would rather join their men. The assault \nwas aided by artillery shelling which effectively neutralized \nMuslim capacity to inflict damage on American troops. Thus,"

American troops and Tausug allies took off secretly for \nPatian and cornered Jikiri and his band, which included his wife. \nJikiri was finally killed after a hand to hand combat liquidated \nthe rest of his band. With the death of Jikiri an irritating era of \n“piracy” came to an end and once again American rule had proven \nits successful campaign against recalcitants in Sulu. \nThe year 1909 marked the beginning of political change from \nthe Tasker Bliss to the John Pershing approach to the government \nor the affairs of the Moro Province. Having proven himself earlier \nin the Lanao campaigns, Gen. Pershing assumed the governorship \nof the Moro Province and started a vigorous “disarmament cam¬ \npaign” in Jolo, in addition to the educational assault on certain \ncultural values and practices such as polygamy, pilgrimage to \nMecca, etc. The result was the revival of resistance which found \ntangible expression in the “Battle of Bud Bagsak” in 1913. \ni /» \n5. Bud Bagsak, 1913 \nRecords show that by June 1912, loose firearms had been \ncollected in Jolo, except in Lati and Luuk where the opposition \nto disarmament was strong. Here began the process for another \nuprising when Panglima Indanan, a powerful leader, was arrested \nand disarmed, together with his aides and sons. This was ac¬ \ncompanied by the violent operations of the Scouts in the Eastern \npart of the Jolo, especially in Lati where the sabilallah attacks on \nAmerican troops became the source of colonial horror. More \nmilitary pressures were exerted on the Lati people but the latter \ndefied the odds and took their stand at Bud Bagsak. The entire \npopulation practically joined the rebellion. The number of \ndefiant rebels was about 6,000 to 10,000, which included about \n10 per cent combatants and warriors. It appeared that the whole \nLati community was defiant against American rule under circum¬ \nstances where the killings of non-combatants was a grim reality. \nThe American authorities appealed for non-combatants and \ncombatants to return to their abandoned farms and homes. \nFinally, many of the non-combatants were persuaded to avoid \nconflict and only the warriors remained determined to fight the \ncolonial forces. Part of the compromise was the withdrawal of \nAmerican troops from Jolo island. \nBut peace was uncertain because the Lati Muslims had kept"

Pershing tried to convince them that American \nintention was not to resort to final use of arms but rather to \npersuade them to surrender their arms for the sake of peace. \nThe reaction to Pershing’s appeal was a defiant resolve to resist \nany effort to disarm them. Convinced that all efforts would be \nfutile, American strategy was to separate the non-combatants \nfrom the combatants. When this was achieved, Pershing ordered \nimmediate troop movements to Bagsak which was reached by \nJune 11, 1913. The defenders of the movement were surprised \nby American breach of the agreement. The resistance against Amer¬ \nican arms was furious and heroic. But it was tragic and senseless \nbecause the massacre of Muslim freedom fighters by Americans \nwas one sided and quick. Governor Pershing tried to justify the \nslaughter of ill-equipped and hopeless defenders by referring \nto them as “notorious cattle thieves and murderers” in the island \nwhose liquidation was welcomed by the “entire population of the \nSulu Archipelago”. For the colonial government, the Bud Bagsak \naffair ended with pax Americana dawning in Sulu as over 500 \nrifles were gathered from the island. But undoubtedly, as sub¬ \nsequent events would show, the Tausug will to resist and the love \nfor liberty had remained unsubdued. \nD. The Cotabato Resistance, 1903-1912 \n1. DatuAli, 1903 \nUnlike in Sulu and Lanao, there were only two significant \nevents that marked Maguindanao’s resistance to American rule. \nOne was in 1903 when Datu Ali, successor to Datu Utu’s mantle \nand son-in-law of Datu Piang, began to defy American offer of \npeace and to persuade the Maranaos to join the anti-colonial \nmovement. The military governor of Cotabato, Capt. Carl Riech- \nman, sent troops to the Rio Grande to prevent the spread of the \nuprising from Cotabato. The troops were intercepted by Ali’s \nforces between Kudarangan and Seneraya. Several of Ali’s follow¬ \ners were killed. In March of 1903, American troops shelled Ali’s \nfort killing many of the defenders. Ali changed tactics from the \ntraditional method of confronting the enemy to the guerrilla-type \nof engagement. Added to this was the use of sabilallahs to harass \nthe Americans during the day while Ali’s warriors attacked Amer¬ \nican troop encampments in the evening. Ali’s defiance continued \nfor almost three years. \nIt was not until March 1906 that American troops finally"

Arms \nand weapons were seized and Djimbangan was held hostage to \nforce Ali to surrender. But Ali refused and was encouraged by \nsupport from several datus. But the prospect of success was \nneutralized by the collaboration of Datu Piang with American \nauthorities. Piang did not support his son-in-law. In fact, Piang \nprovided American troops with information and other assistance. \nFinally, on October 22, 1906 Ali was cornered by troops under \nFrank McCoy while resting outside a hut in Simpetan. On October \n31, thirteen of Ali’s followers were killed, including him and \nthree of his sons. \n2. Datu Alamada, 1912 \nHowever, Ali’s death did not end Maguindanao’s defiance of \nAmerican rule. In 1912 Datu Alamada and 300 followers rose in \nrebellion, supported by thousands of sympathizers who vowed \nnot to accept American sovereignty. His movements were con¬ \ncentrated in Buldon and Upper Cotabato. Late in 1912 local \ncollaborators, led by Datu Inuk, offered two plans to assist in \nthe apprehension or killing of Alamada. The first plan was to \ninfiltrate Alamada’s group and kill him. The second option was \nfor Datu Piang and him to persuade Alamada to surrender and \nthen, liquidate Alamada’s band. The government opted for direct \nnegotiations. \nThe negotiations were led by American and Filipino officials. \nThey finally convinced Alamada to yield by offering to resettle \nhim and his people in a colony near Pikit. But ;he opted to \nsurrender to a Filipino rather than to an American official. \nThere were othe r Muslim disturbances in the Muslim south. \nBut they were no longer as organized and sustained by popular \nsupport as in the first decade of American rule. The disturbances \nwere either isolated, personal or small group encounters staged \nby recalcitrants from the Muslim masses. Many of the elites \nor aatus who spearheaded the anti-colonial struggle had been \nneutralized as a sector by military pressure and divide and rule \ntactics. Consequently, many of the incidence of violence recorded \ninvolved inter-Muslim conflicts which the Americans allowed \nand even encouraged to destroy Muslim capacity to resist. \nThe only incidents noted in the second deciade of American \nrule were the ‘ Balabac Incident” in 1916 and the tension at"

But like the rest of the \nearlier violence, the incidents were neutralized. \nE. The Highlander’s Reaction \na. Back to Tradition \nIn the late 19th century, the tribal groups had, to a certain \nextent joined the revolutionary movement against colonialism. Al¬ \nthough theyivere not integrated into the Aguinaldo government and \narmed forces, they nevertheless opposed the Spanish elements \nquite often because of what they perceived to be a definite Spanish \neffort to subdue them and to change their way of life. In Luzon, \nthis type of reaction was represented by the Igorot armed struggle \nuntil the end of Spanish rule. In Mindanao, the Manobos joined \nthe Muslim response to Spanish foothold by providing assistance \nto political leaders in need of support. \nBut the American entry into the archipelago neutralized \nwhatever violent reaction the tribal groups had against colonial \nrule. The tribal communities either continued to recoil further \ninto the safety of inaccessible sanctuaries or they accepted the \nconciliatory approach of American rule which made effective \nuse of schools, churches, and medical services to win tribal con¬ \nfidence and friendship. \nThe tribal communities in Luzon were won over by American \nEpiscopal missionaries, and later, by medical missions and schools. \nThe same was true in the Visayas, particulary in Negros and \nIloilo, where Presbyterian missions contributed to health and \nsanitation and education at the grassroots level. Eventually, the \nconciliatory and humanitarian work produced a core of native \ncollaborators who gradually assumed the work of reaching out \nto their own people with* just general supervisory control from \nthe colonial officials. \nIn the Mindanao area, the work of pacification was also \nundertaken by American laymen, enterpreneurs, and teachers, \nparticularly during the period of the Moro Province from 1903 \nto 1906. The Lunds and Lamassons in the Subanun country of \nZamboanga opened the socio-economic potentials of the area. \nCoconuts were introduced in Lapuyan and other areas to improve \nagricultural income. But perhaps, more effective were the efforts"

The general effect of these socio-economic activi¬ \nties was to neutralize any resistance to colonial rule. \nb. The Subanun Affair, 1909 \nThe only violent disturbance reported in Mindanao was in \n1909 among the Subanons. The Constabulary report from the \nFifth District to the headquarters in Zamboanga referred to a \n“fight” on November 28 at the sitio of Bobhoran between govern¬ \nment forces under Capt. H.H. Elarth and about eight to nine \nhundred Subanuns and Moros. \nBefore the encounter, the headman of Bobhoran reported on \nNovember 1 that thousands of Subanuns were leaving their homes \nand farms and were heading towards the mountains of Dapeok \nand Malindang on the “call of two boy prophets” who told them \nthat the end of the world was coming. He declared that the sea \nwould cover all the lands except the highest peaks and all who \nwould not seek refuge in the sacred mountains would drown \nand die.

This prospect became quite \nclear when the American colonial authorities repeatedly offered \nopportunities for Filipino cooperation and participation in the \ncolonial government. In fact, the encouragement from the colonial \nofficials was irresistible to the Filipino elite, especially the ilustra- \ndos, whose role in the 19th century revolutionary movement \nthroughout the archipelago, had been marked by readiness to \ncompromise with colonialism. They did not find it inconsistent \nat all to extend cooperation, first, to Spanish rule, and, now, to \nthe American colonial venture. The extent and nature of Filipino \ninvolvement in the pursuit of American colonialism can be cate¬ \ngorized under several leadings. \nA. Involvement During the Military Phase, 1899-1913 \nIn 1899, the Schurman Commission, the first significant \nbody created by President McKinley, with Jacob Schurman, \nPresident of Cornell University, as head, initiated the non-military \napproach of American colonialism and succeeded, after several \nmonths, in laying down the foundation of a subtle conquest of \nthe Philippines through the cooperation of the Filipino elite. \nThere was really no difficulty in winning over the elite, as Schur¬ \nman readily recognized, judging from the enthusiastic response \nof those who would later figure prominently in the electoral \nprocess as well as in executive appointments.

The landowning class and the ilus- \ntrados decided, upon the entry of the United States in the \nislands, to cooperate with the American colonialists. Prominent \namong the Negros elite who eventually became the stalwart \nsupporters of American rule were Juan Araneta, Jose Luzuriaga, \nLeandro Locsin, Demetrio Larena, and Agustin Montilla. As \nearly as November 1898 they organized themselves into a pro¬ \nvisional government clearly opposed to the Aguinaldo revo¬ \nlutionary government, hoping that by this step they would be \nable to get the American authorities to accept their offer of \nloyalty to American rule. Efforts were exerted to contact the \nAmerican authorities in the Visayas in order that they could \nconsider the desire of the Negros elite to make the island under \neffective American control. But it was not until late in February \n1899 that a committee of prominent landowners from Negros \nwere welcomed by the military government under Gen. E. Otis \nwho, subsequently, on March 1,1899, created the Visayan Military \ndistrict with Gen. James F. Smith as Governor of Negros. \nWith the American government now established in Negros, \nthe Negrense provincial junta became its useful ally in the Amer¬ \nican countermeasures against the Malolos government, represented \nin Negros by Aguinaldo-appointed emissaries, Quintin Salas and \nZoilo Mauricio, and the masses led by their charismatic leader, \n“Papa Isio” or Dionisio Magbuela in real life. Attempts by Agui¬ \nnaldo to win the elite failed and the open conflict between the \ncolonial forces and the Malolos government erupted. As noted \nearlier, the armed disturbances in the Visayas, including Negros, \nwere now definitely led by those who came from below, and the \ncolonial government and the Filipino elite found the suppression \nof the disturbances not only costly but also difficult. The elite \nwere particuarly plagued by attacks on their properties and lands. \nBut the conflict only drew the elite closer to colonialism. \nThe same pattern of collaboration and compromise also was \nevident in Luzon. The Schurman Commission organized muni¬ \ncipal governments, starting with the first in Baliwag, Bulacan.

Thus, by 1901, the American \ncolonial government could disclose the pacification of the islands \nand the establishment of the civil government except in the \nMuslim South where civil rule would not be formed until the \nabolition of the military-governed Moro Province in 1913. The \npattern of municipal organization was guided by a plan formulated \nby a Committee headed by Chief Justice Cayetano Arellano of \nthe Supreme Court. \nb. In the Central Government \nThe most important manifestation of American cooperation of \nthe elite was in the national level of administration. Being a highly \ncentralized government, those few occupying the top executive, \nlegislative, and judicial positions exercised vast powers and in¬ \nfluence in national affairs. The involvement of the Filipino elite \nin this level was represented by those who were appointed as \nmembers of the Philippine Commission which performed executive \nand legislative powers and functions. Examples were Gregorio \nAraneta and Benito Legarda. It was in the judiciary where the \nFilipino elite was given substantial role in the person of Cayetano \nArellano who was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. \nJustice Arellano, a professor of law of Santo Tomas and top \npractising lawyer, was clear about his inclination and conviction. \nHe believed in the sovereignty of the United States over the \nPhilippines. \nc. Why the Elite \nThe question that often recurs is why the Americans easily \ncoopted the elite for colonial purposes and why the elite had no \ndifficulty in shifting loyalty from Filipino to American rule. \nThere were two basic reasons for the elite’s readiness to accept \ncolonialism. First was the natural fear of losing the security \nof their interests because of the growing demand of the masses \nfor the redistribution of economic benefits and resources. There \nwas still the reluctance to part with elite privileges in a feudal \nset-up where those of mixed blood had advantages over the \nnative. It was clear that American colonial interests would be \nready to accommodate, in the total scheme of things, the elite’s \ndesire to preserve their privileges. In fact, comparatively speaking, \nthe prospects under American rule were much better than under"

The second reason is the basic \norientation of the elite, which felt distrust in the integrity and \ncharacter of the masses whom the elite regarded as potential \ntrouble makers, bandits, and enemies of what they represented \nin society. Added to this low regard for the integrity of the \nmasses was the contempt of the elite for what appeared as their \ngeneral lack of knowledge, lo\\y intellectual capacity, and question¬ \nable moral standard. In brief, the elite could not trust their \ninterests and future in the hands of the masses. The remarks \nand opinions of Cayetano Arellano and Trinidad Pardo de Tavera \nwere examples of their condescending attitude toward the Filipino \nmasses similar to the way the Spanish colonizers looked at the \nnatives. Pardo de Tavera was particularly notorious in his con¬ \ntempt for those below his class. The pro-Americanism of the elite \nwas, to the Americans, not only encouraging but also remarkable \nfor colonial purposes. It would not be long before the ilustrados \nwould find the founding of the Federal Party not only a logical \nexpression of their sentiment but also a political mechanism for \nhelping the colonial administration in the intellectual redirection \nof the Filipino people. \n2. The Cultural Communities \nIn the cultural communities, the Americans were also success¬ \nful in coopting the ruling elite at the start of American rule. \nIn the tribal communities, American teachers and missionaries \nopened the path to an understanding of American benevolent policy \nthrough schools, religious missions, and especially, medical work. \na. In Mindanao \nIt was a part of the American strategy to make use of the \nlocal datus and leaders to promote the need for social services. \nThe building of schools was undertaken with American super¬ \nvision of native workers using existing local materials. This was, \nfor instance, illustrated by Datu Santiago of Cotabato and his \nmen. The same was true of the campaign against insanitary living \nconditions and diseases especially those that frequently led to \nepidemics like cholera, dysentery, smallpox, and malaria. Local \nleaders, with only a few exceptions, helped by setting personal \nexamples of hygiene and proper sanitation. Education of children \nwas very much emphasized, especially those of the ruling class. \nThe schools for the Subanuns, the Tausugs in Sulu, and even a"

Gen. John J. Pershing. He \nremarked: “The school system depends for its success entirely \nupon the American teachers, and although Filipino teachers do \nexcellent work under proper supervision, educational direction \nmust for some time remain in the hands of the American teachers.” \nOne of the most effective instruments of American educational \npolicies was Dr. Najeeb M. Saleeby, a medical practitioner turned \neducator. His background as a Christian Arab, with education \nobtained from the American University in Beirut and a medical \ndegree from New York’s Bellevue Medical School, gave him the \nkind of advantage to deal with the education of the Muslims \nin the Moro Province. His knowledge of Arabic and Islam provided \nhim with a personal touch that enabled him to win a lot of friends \namong the Muslim leaders, including those that were opposed to \nAmerican rule like Datu Ali of Cotabato, the royalties of Sulu, \nand the datus of Lanao. His initial work as a medical surgeon \nin Malabang, Lanao provided opportunities to win the Ilanuns, \na Muslim sub-ethnic group that had been associated with piratical \nattacks on trading vessels in the southern seas. Consequently, \nhis appointment as School Superintendent for the District of \nMindanao and Jolo on June 1, 1903, after a brief assignment as \nAssistant Chief of the Bureau of Non Christian Tribes, led to the \nvigorous implementation of American educational objectives in \nthe Moro Province. At the time of his tenure, there were 52 \nelementary schools in the province with a total enrollment of \n2,114 pupils, 240 of whom were Muslims. The schools were \nhandled by 15 American teachers, 50 Christians and 9 Muslims. \nBy the time he resigned, on June 30, 1906 to become the new \nSecretary of the Moro Province under Governor Tasker H. Bliss, \nthe school enrollment had reached 4,231 pupils. The Muslim \nenrollees also grew to 570. But lack of sympathetic understand¬ \ning from his superiors frustrated Saleeby’s efforts and his views \non the approach to the “Moro Problem” were somehow diluted. \nOther American teachers who contributed to the reorienta¬ \ntion of Mindanao included both military and non-military person¬ \nnel.

In the Cordillera \nIn the Cordillera, the Americans were confronted by the \nmany problems of the Filipino-American War which had brought \nthe retreating forces of 200 Filipinos under Aguinaldo to the \ntraditionally hostile Ifugao country. To outside forces, the \nIfugao head-hunting activities were c onstant problems. But the \npressure was not as difficult as the Spanish and Aguinaldo forces. \nThe Americans had impressive firepower which impressed the \nIfugaos, reinforced by a practice of avoiding outright confiscation \nof food resources and valuables and readiness to assist in rendering \nspeedy justice in disputes and conflict. These advantages were \nreadily seen when the American troops, in pursuit of Agui- \nnaldo’s “reflating column,” found themselves dealing with \nseveral Cordillera groups, especially those in the Ifugao region. \nThey demonstrated American firepower when the Ifugaos took \nthe head of an Arr erican soldier. They also paid prices \nfor the chickens, pigs, and food items made available by the \nIfugaos who had not anticipated such an attitude, having experi¬ \nenced the opposite from Spanish and Filipino forces earlier. \nThen, in the conflict between two Ifugao groups (Sabangan and \nHapao), American guns made the difference. Consequently, \nHumiwat, the leader of an Ifugao band that beheaded an Amer¬ \nican soldier, surrendered and offered his cooperation in the \nAmerican effort to establish a presence in the Cordillera. By \n1902, the ground was prepared for the American colonial govern¬ \nment to study the set-up in the Cordillera through Dr. David \nP. Barrows who became the head of the Bureau of Non-Christian \nTribes.

Only the Nagacaran Ifugaos \nresisted the offer and boycotted the meeting. \nThe pacification efforts of the Americans found very encour¬ \naging prospects in the pioneering activities of former military men \nlike Samuel Kane and A1 Hora whose business explorations and \nadventures provided later American officers and officials insights \ninto Ifugao character and psychology. Army officers, like Capt. \nLewis Patstone in Nueva Vizcaya and Lt. Levi Case in Ifugao \ncountry, contributed a lot in preparing the Ifugaos for the event¬ \nual establishment of American political structures in the area, \nintegrating not only the Ifugaos but also the other Igorots into the \nConstabulary as soldiers and into the local government as presi- \ndentes (mayors) or cabecillas. By the beginning of 1906 the entry \nof Lt. Jeff D. Gallman into Ifugao country saw the beginning of \nan era of peace among the Ifugaos and American rule set the \npace and patterns for the rest of the Cordillera. \nc. Treaty Traps \nIn Southern Philippines, Muslim leadership was already divided \ninto those who opposed and those who accepted American \npresence in 1899. But the latter group, which was represented \nby those in Sulu, allowed American presence without necessarily \naccepting American sovereignty. In fact, the Bates Treaty signed \nby Sultan Jamalul Kiram and Gen. John C. Bates on August 20, \n1899, clearly expressed this sort of political compromise. The \nSulu signatories to the treaty revealed the extent to which local \nSulu leadership was involved in the American peace initiative. \nWith Datu Kalbi and Datu Julkanain signing the document, the \nPatikul political leadership had been added to those who supported \nAmerican rule. This was a significant accomplishment of Amer¬ \nican diplomacy because it represented, at the close of the 19th \ncentury, the only meaningful opposition to the Sultanate whose \npolitical center was in Maimbung, the flourishing trading point \nin the southern part of Jolo. In the same manner, Patikul was \nthe center of activities in the northern part. The treaty, there¬ \nfore, put behind American rule the entire political leadership \nof Sulu, leaving opposition to colonialism to lesser known leaders \nnot connected with the ruling elite. \nThe Treaty guaranteed peace between the Americans and \nMuslims in Sulu, but it should be noted that from the perspective"

Under the treaty, \nthe local leaders agreed to allow the Americans the freedom to \ntrade and engage in commerce as well as the right to fly their \nown flag. Likewise, the Americans agreed not to interfere in the \ninternal affairs of the people, and in case of disputes and conflicts, \nto act in consultation with the local leaders, especially the Sultan. \nThese were the general understanding and agreement guaranteed \nby the treaty as perceived by the local signatories. The Tausug \nversion of the treaty clearly substantiates this view. \nBut the English version of the Treaty clearly provides for \nthe establishment of American rule in Sulu and the acceptance \nof American sovereignty by the Sultan and the datus. The version \nallowed the Americans to interfere even in the resolution of \ndisputes concerning matters related to slavery, taxes, peace and \norder, trade, commerce, foreign relations, except in matters \npertaining to religious practices and customs.

The treaty \nabrogration terminated the financial annuities the Sultan and \nother signatories had been receiving from the Americans since the \nconclusion of the agreement. But, perhaps, more felt was the \ndishonor and shame the American action had brought on the \nSulu leadership. Such an insult was bound to further erode the \npopular regard for the Sultanate as a political entity, especially \nafter the demonstrations of American military technology in \nLanao and Cotabato where Moro armed disturbances were effect¬ \nively suppressed. The eruption of uprisings after 1904, particularly \nthe Hassan Revolt, was partly attributed by the Americans to the \nencouragement given by the Sultan. The latter's denial did not \nerode the American suspicion of the Sultan’s active and clandestine \ninvolvement iri the series of disturbances which culminated in the \nbloody battle of Bud Bagsak m 1913."

The Carpenter-Kiram Agreement, 1915 \nThe effect of the persisting American belief in the Sultan’s \ninvolvement led to the further emasculation of the sultanate \nthrough the Kiram-Carpenter Agreement of March 22, 1915, \nThe agreement divested the Sultan of all his political power and \nprerogative. He was only allowed to exercise the rights and \nduties of a spiritual leader. Since under Islam there is no sepa¬ \nration of power, the agreement created problems for the Sultan. \nIt would be difficult to truly exercise spiritual influence without \nthe political authority the Sultan previously enjoyed. Hence, \nthe Sultanate itself was seriously affected by the emasculation \nof the powers of the Sultan from which recovery would sub¬ \nsequently prove extremely difficult. \nIn the “Note” prelimary to the main part of the Agreement, \nreference was made to certain political facts and realities as \ngrounds for the unquestionable assumption by the United States \nof sovereignty over all that pertained to the Sultanate. These are: \n(1) recognition of the independent sovereignty of the Sultanate \nprior to American occupation; (2) the recognition of the partial \nexercise of sovereignty of the Sultanate by Spain during the \nlatter part of the Spanish occupation of the Philippines but only \nin relation to foreign affairs and, to a lesser degree, only on the \nport of Jolo and four other points occupied by “ Spanish military \ngarrisons”; and (3) the recognition of a partial but de facto \ntemporal sovereignty of the United States under the Bates Treaty, \nwhose provisions in Article IX allowed the United States to deal \nwith cases of crimes and offenses “committed by Moros against \nMoros”. What was underlined in the note was that the abrogation \nof the Bates Treaty by the United States was premised on “other \nmatters than the de jure sovereignty of the Sultan,” who neither \nlost nor relinquished his sovereignty by conquest or otherwise \nuntil the signing of the agreement by Sultan Jamalul Kiram and \nGovernor Frank W. Carpenter. \nThe stipulations of the Agreement, expressed in no uncertain \nterms in five paragraphs, emphasized the total sovereignty of the \nUnited States over all the territory of the Sultanate in all aspects, \nexcept in matters of religion in which the Sultan, as titular spiritual \nhead of his people, was allowed to exercise ecclesiastical authority. \nBut even this exercise of spiritual or religious authority and its \nattendant enjoyment of religious freedom must not be in violation \nof the basic principles of the laws of the United States.

Political Charge in the United States \nIn 1912, the political climate in the United States had changed. \nNot only was a new president coming in — Woodrow Wilson — but \na new political orientation was expected to emerge from the \nchange to Democratic rule. Since the turn of the century the \nRepublican leadership had kept the conservative tradition of \nAmerican policies unaltered, particularly in relation to colonial \nexpansion. The Republican Administration had been associated \nwith the acquisition of overseas colonies and the maintenance \nof those colonies for the business or economic interests of Amer¬ \nican society. In a sense, the establishment of American colonies, \nincluding the Philippines, was part of the expansionist inertia \nthat came from the vigorous, westward expansion of the American \ncolonists to the vast frontiers of Indian territories looking for new \nopportunities and lands until the Pacific coast of California was \nreached. It was here at the littoral of the west coast that the \nAmerican spirit of conquest was literally challenged by the vast \nocean that lay before it. \nThe inertia of the westward movement was there. It only \nneeded the mitigation of other pressures that had transformed \nAmerica from a rural to an urban technological society. The need \nfor raw materials and markets added an economic dimension to \nAmerican territorial expansion just as the influence of the Great \nCommission brought in the religious vision of the fundamentalists \nof America to see the gospel message preached to the “regions \nbeyond.” All these political, economic and socio-cultural motiva¬ \ntions were ideals the Republican Party had sought to uphold. \n2. Effects on Colony \nThe Democratic Party administration, which differed to some \nextent from the Republican, was expected to bring some changes \nin American expansionist policy and direction. It had been associ¬ \nated with the populist interests of American society, with the \nworking men and farmers. Therefore, the acquisition and main-"

But the policy \nadopted did not altogether lead to the abandonment of the acquired \nterritories. Possessions like the Philippines were maintained but \nthe measure of control was somewhat modified to allow greater \nnative participation in government and the realistic preparation \nfor eventual independence. \nWhat, therefore, followed the Republican defeat in the Presi¬ \ndential election of 1912 was the appointment, in 1913, of Francis \nBurton Harrison as the first Democratic Governor General for \nthe Philippines. As subsequent developments would show, Amer¬ \nican rule in the Philippines under Harrison saw the realistic imple¬ \nmentation of American policies, the change from mere theoretical \nto actual grant of substantial participation in the government \nto Filipinos. In the executive branch, there was a change from \nan American to a Filipino majority in the Philippine Commission \nin 1913 and in the Council of State and the Board of Control in \n1918.

By \nthe end of Harrison’s term in 1921, the Civil Service had only \nabout six per cent Americans. \nThis “rapid Filipinization” of the government, as Harrison’s \ncolonial policy was called, was also evident in the legislative \nbranch of the government. Before 1916, legislation was still \nunder the dominant control of the Americans. Only the Philip¬ \npine Assembly, which was created in 1907, was Filipino. But, \nby virtue of its function as the ‘ lower house,” it was subordi¬ \nnate to the Philippine Commission which serve as the “upper \nhouse” and, at the same time, as a Cabinet of the Governor \nGeneral. It was not until the Jones Law was passed in 1916 \nthat the legislative power in the islands was given to the Filipinos. \nOnly the veto power of the Chief Executive in a presidential \n.system remained as the source of American control over legisla¬ \ntion. Under the Jones Law a bicameral legislature was created \ncomposed of a 24-member Senate as the upper house and a \nHouse of Representatives as the house Chamber. All the members \nof the legislature were elected except the two Senators from the \nnon-Christian sector, who were appointed by the Governor General. \nWhile the national structure was opening up to Filipino \n. irticipation, the local government continued to strengthen the"

The American influence was in the position of \nprovincial treasurer which was held by Americans. Except for the \ngeneral power of supervision, the municipal government was under \nFilipino control. \nThe judiciary had already seen substantial Filipino participa¬ \ntion since the creation of the Supreme Court in 1899. In 1901 \nCayetano Arellano became Chief Justice. The lower courts had \nboth American and Filipino judges, with the latter increasingly \ngrowing in number. \nC. Limits to Filipinization \n1. Restraints of Elitism \nWhile Filipinization gained momentum under the Harrison \nadministration, there was a fundamental limitation to the extent \nof its enjoyment in Filipino society. It was obvious that from \nthe list of those who represented the Filipinos in the various \nlevels of the bureaucracy, Filipinization involved only the upper \ncrust of Filipino society, those who belonged to the national and \nlocal elite. Without exception, the Filipino members of the \nPhilippine Commission were from the landlord and capitalist \nfamilies; so were those in the choice positions in the Civil Service; \nEven. the municipal level of the government was manned by \nelective officials who came from the local elite. This was insured \nby the limitation of the electoral choice to only qualified residents. \nUnder the law those who could run for office must be able to \nread and write, and must be property owners, or have been govern¬ \nment employees during the Spanish period. In effect, the election \nlaw already limited participation to the elite. \nThis confinement of Filipino participation to the elite guaran¬ \nteed the success of American colonial administration, notwith¬ \nstanding the numerical dominance of the Filipinos in government. \nThe elite had already demonstrated the positive role they could \nplay and the Americans clearly saw the natural inclination of the \nelite to meaningful practical collaboration with the colonial \npower. The interests of the elite were compatible with that of \ncolonialism and the Americans were ready to give them a signif¬ \nicant share of power, wealth, and status in the islands. Not only \nwere their traditional rights and privileges recognized but also \ntheir right to a new access to external power which they could \nnot have acquired without compromising with the colonial power."

Consequently, the Amer¬ \nican liberal approach to compromise with Filipino leadership \nearned for the United States the cooperation and loyalty of the \nFilipino elite. This was, perhaps, the underlying basis of American \nreadiness to give more and more to Filipinos the administration \nof the bureaucracy except the highest executive post in the \nislands, the position of Secretary of Public Instruction and the \npositions controlling the finances of the islands such as the Na¬ \ntional Treasury, the Bureau of Customs, the Bureau of Internal \nRevenue, and the local treasuries. The control of the sources of \nrevenues and their use was enough to neutralize any adverse \neffects of Filipinization on American control in the colony. The \nAmerican authorities knew that aside from a superior military \nforce, economic control is basic to political control. \nThus, Filipinization, as implemented by the Democratic \nadministration, fitted into the overall scheme of colonial rule. It \nwas an aid, not hindrance, to colonial compromise for as long as \nit could be kept within the upper crust of Filipino society. But \nthe moment it was extended to those who came from below, such \nas would occur in the 1920s and 1930s, Filipinization would \ninvite the threat to American liberal democratic rule. What \nemerged, however, from the colonial version of Filipinization \nwas the dilemma of the Filipino elite, and the problems of Fili¬ \npino values in the bureaucracy. \n2. Economic Limitation \nThe dilemma of Filipino leadership was best seen in the \neconomic relations with the United States during the Harrison era \n(1913-1920). Before this period, the economic policy of the \nUnited States was anchored entirely on the ambiguities of the \nParis Treaty of 1898 and later, on the “free trade” provisions \nof the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act of 1909. Until 1909, American \neconomic interests would be affected by the most-favored-nation \ntreatment given to Spain for a period of ten years under the \nTreaty of Paris, thus preventing the enactment of any trade \npolicy favorable to American economic interests. The end of the \nten-year privilege in 1909 gave the United States the first oppor¬ \ntunity to initiate what became popularly known as “Free Trade.” \nThis was a unique kind of relation because the exercise of free¬ \ndom by the United States and the Philippines was not equal."

The limita¬ \ntion to Filipino economic interests involved the volume and kind \nof export, while no similar restriction was placed on American \ninterests. Consequently, the Philippines became almost an ex¬ \nclusive American market with American goods literally moving \ninto the colony without limitation. But Philippine exports to the \nAmerican market were governed by quotas and limited only to \nraw materials needed by American business. Thus, as relations \nof economic dependency became the pattern of Philippine rela¬ \ntions with the United States, conversely, American control of the \nPhilippine economy, and consequently, Philippine leadership, \nwas firmly established by the time the Underwood-Simmons \nTariff Act was enacted in 1913 abolishing the quotas on Philip¬ \npine exports. \nThere was, therefore, “free trade” literally between the \nPhilippines and the United States during Harrison’s term and \nbeyond, until 1934 when the quotas were reimposed by the \nTydings-McDuffie law. It was during this liberal trade policy \nthat the partnership between Filipino and American economic \ninterests was strengthened by the dependence of the Filipino land¬ \nowning class on lucrative American markets for their agricultural \nexports. This economic dependence would continue to be rein¬ \nforced through the years and the role of the Filipino elite would \nalso be inextricably tied to the preservation of American rights \nand privileges not only in the economic area but also in the poli¬ \ntical, social, and cultural fields. \nD. Social Effects of Filipinization \n1. Tradition vs. Modernism \nThe establishment of American liberal democracy as the new \npattern of the Filipino way of life would bring about the con¬ \nfrontation between Filipino traditional ways and the new system. \nThe basic differences in values would eventually create a dicho¬ \ntomy of systems in which a democratic form and a traditional \nessence were welded to create a “democracy Filipino style”. \nFrom the outside, the world saw the American democratic \nstructure in the Philippines largely manned by “little brown \nAmericans,” illustrating one of the most successful colonial \nexperiments in the non-Westem world.

Added to all these democratic activities \nwas a dynamic cultural process which involved the introduction \nand propagation of American popular activities such as ball games, \nrestaurants and eateries, movies, sports, and arts. In brief, the \nAmerican democratic style had found a distinct place in Filipino \nlife. \n2.

The \nAmericans regarded the persistence of traditional values as coun¬ \nter productive to the new democracy. Reports of petty violations \nof law began to create concern. These violations were noted \nin such activities ranging from petty thieveries to bribery of \nemployees in government and shady financial deals. Even Fili¬ \npino disregard for working time was noted so that the common \nperception of colonial officials was that rapid Filipinization \nwas disastrous to American colonial administration and that \nHarrison erred in giving to Filipinos more and more responsi¬ \nbilities and powers. What the Americans failed to see was the \nfact that the Filipinos saw no contradiction between the new \ndemocratic institutions and traditional practices.

It recom¬ \nmended that “the present general status of the Philippine Islands \ncontinue until the people have had time to absorb and thoroughly \nmaster the powers already in their hands.” \nThe Administration of Leonard Wood (1921-1927) \nThe choice of Leonard Wood as Governor General demonstra¬ \nted that President Harding accepted the Wood-Forbes Mission’s \nrecommendations as to Philippine policy and that he looked to \nWood to remedy the unfortunate conditions pointed out in the \nMission’s report.

He was deter¬ \nmined to govern and to assume active leadership to remedy the \nmaladministration which he had found in the country. His deter¬ \nmination to truly govern was met by the Filipino leaders with \ncounter-offensives, for they interpreted this as a threat to the \nautonomy they already enjoyed. Accustomed as they were to \nplaying a dominant role during the previous Harrison adminis¬ \ntration, they desired supremacy in insular affairs, and no inter¬ \nference from the Governor General except in matters directly \naffecting the interests of the United States in the Philippines. \nWood not only found himself unable to sympathize with \nthe desire of the Filipino nationalists for an increasing measure of \nself-government, but he also opposed independence, except \nperhaps in the very distant future. The American government, he \nexplained, would not consider any extension of further autonomy \nuntil the weaknesses pointed out in the Wood-Forbes Mission \nReport had been corrected. Complete independence would not \nbe opposed, he said, if the Filipinos were “industrially strong and \ncould defend themselves and hold their country.” He advised \nthe Filipinos to cooperate wholeheartedly in making the govern¬ \nment efficient, for in so doing they would strengthen their plea \nfor independence.

In the first session of the Seventh Legislature in \n1925, twenty-four out of sevenjty-two bills were vetoed; and in \nthe second session in 1926, the Legislature passed 122 bills, out \nof which 44 were vetoed. Harrison vetoed only five measures \nin seven years in office. \nNot only did the Governor exercise liberally his power to \nveto bills passed by the Legislature, but he even went to the \nextent of altering measures already passed by the Legislature, \nand then affixing his signature after the alteration was made. \nThe Filipino leaders were also annoyed that Wood should veto \nbills of local interest and insisted that before the Governor \nGeneral acted unfavorably on any bill, their views must first \nbe heard. \nNearly all vetoes, Wood explained, were due to serious defects \nor unconstitutional provisions. This unsatifactory condition was \nlargely due to the rushing through of a large number of bills \nduring the last hours of the session, without opportunity being"

This delay, Wood maintained, \noccurred every year and often prevented desirable legislation \nfrom being approved. In some instances, Wood was convinced \nthat the Filipino leaders deliberately showered him with im¬ \npracticable legislation to draw his vetoes and thus give them fresh \nopportunity to charge him with ‘‘despotism.” \nThe Board of Control Controversy \nWood was determined to get the government out of business, \nthe government in Harrison’s time having created and controlled \nstocks in various government corporations through the Board of \nControl. Wood was convinced that the Board was illegal because \nthe Governor General occupied a minority position in it (in \nviolation of the Organic Act which placed supreme executive \ncontrol in the hands of the Governor General), and so he could \nnever get the consent of the two Filipino members (the Senate \nPresident and the House Speaker) to get the government out of \nbusiness. \nThere were two fundamental reasons advanced by Wood for \ngetting the government out of business: first, that the Philip¬ \npine treasury needed the money invested in the business enter¬ \nprises to spend it for the greater benefit of the public; and second, \nthat governments were not qualified, in any nation of the world, \nto conduct business or engage in any industries which would \ncompete with private initiative. Wood was unhappy with the \ngraft and mismanagement which he saw and felt that the only \nhope for the enterprises was to put them in the hands of experi¬ \nenced American businessmen. \nThe Filipino leaders, on the other hand, wished the continuance \nof the companies and a share in their management through the \nBoard of Control, for to them, acceptance of the Governor’s \npolicy would have meant domination by American capital, a \nsituation which might prejudice their campaign for independence. \nAll efforts toward amicable settlement proved futile. \nBy early 1926, Governor Wood had reached the end of his \npatience with the “perfectly impossible” Board of Control and \nwas eager to get rid of the dominating control in it of Quezon \nand Roxas. On November 9, 1926, acting upon opinions received \nfrom American officials in Washington, he abolished the Board of \nControl, thus removing what he saw as the most serious encroach- \nm* nt on the executive power in the Philippines.

The friction grew out \nof the Governor’s program to restore American supervision and \ncontrol, paicicularly with respect to the functions of the Legis¬ \nlature. But there were some who thought it was greatly exa¬ \ncerbated by the clash between the personal ambitions of the \nFilipino political leaders and Wood’s desire to exercise what he \nsaw as “the inherent rights of the Governor General.” And be¬ \ncause the contest was hopelessly enmeshed in the consuming \nemotional issue of independence, the political rancor was fanned \nby distrust and prejudice. \nAny Governor General who was sent to the Philippines after \nHarrison probably would have found the Filipino leaders parti¬ \ncularly difficult to handle, unless he went as far as Harrison did \nin allowing the Filipinos a generous share in the direction of their \naffairs. Wood was of a different mind - - he was convinced that \nthe Filipinos had taken an enormous stride backward during \nthe Harrison administration. He found v.*e Philippine govern¬ \nment bogged down in a major financial crisis and riddled with \ninefficiency, graft and nepotism. He, therefore, saw it as his \nresponsibility to reform the “critical situation” and restore the \ncountry to an efficient and orderly government worthy of Amer¬ \nican sponsorship. He probably had the right prescription for the \nPhilippines — honesty in government and a tight administration \nbut his approach was hardly the most effective one. Contentious \nand imperial, he showed little consideration for the sensitive \nfeelings of the Filipinos, for whom self-esteem, personal honor, \nand that incomprehensible (to the Westerner) worship of “face” \nwere important matters. Governor Wood’s experience all his life \nhad been that of an administrator with absolute authority, con¬ \ncerned with results.

It was even more unreal to expect \nthat the Filipinos would elect self-government under foreign \ntutelage in preference to complete independence. For the United \nStates had consciously set about to encourage Philippine national¬ \nism and through political, economic, and educational devices, had \nadvanced the desires as well as the means for its expression. \nNo doubt Wood’s opposition to independence was due also \nto what he sincerely believed was the Filipino position. He \naccepted that the Filipinos all wanted independence, but be¬ \nlieved they were willing to trust the good faith of America so \nlong as America did not seek to take a backward step (in rela¬ \ntion to insular autonomy) and did not seek to turn the Philip¬ \npines over to interests which would exploit them and keep them \npermanently. \nIt is unfortunate that Quezon and his colleagues felt them¬ \nselves forced to maintain a false and insincere position when they \ninsisted on complete, immediate, and absolute independence,"

It was \nWood’s wish that the United States would hold the Philippines \nuntil a young and clearer-visioned class of leaders had succeeded \nto power.

It likewise \nbrought into focus the sometimes uncertain steps taken by the \nFilipino leadership to articulate and accept the concept of an \nindependent Filipino nation. The Filipino stand on independ¬ \nence was not always very clear — there was considerable confusion \nand vacillation on the matter — and American administration \nofficials felt that much of the agitation was artificial and thought¬ \nless and too much tied up with insular politics. Political leaders \nvied with one another to demonstrate the intensity of their \nadvocacy of independence. \nThough there was ambivalence in the Philippine approach \nto independence, perhaps part of the uncertainty was due to the \nfact that the United States also had no effective answer for Philip¬ \npine independence — the only matter that was definite was the \npromise to grant independence in the future. Nevertheless each \nside was afforded the opportunity to formulate policy as they \nopenly discussed the issue of Philippine independence. \nIn 1916 the Filipinos received the promise of independence \n“as soon as a stable government can be established” by them. \nThe promise contained in the preamble of the Jones Law provided \nimpetus to the rising tide of Filipino aspirations for immediate \nindependence.

Heretofore the demand for independence \nhad been voiced by means of formal resolutions of the Philippine \nAssembly [and after 1916, of the Philippine Legislature] delivered \nto the American Congress through the Resident Commissioners \nin Washington, of which Manuel L. Quezon was probably the most \nimpressive. After 1918, a more sustained effort to terminate \nAmerican rule would be undertaken, with the appeal for freedom \ntaken directly by the Filipinos to Washington through the par¬ \nliamentary missions or legislative committees sent by the Com¬ \nmission of Independence. \nThe leaders who involved themselves in this campaign had \nbeen on the Philippine political scene from 1907 — all members \nof the educated elite and all products of American tutelage. \nAfter two decades of American direction, these politically active \nFilipinos felt confident that they had sufficiently advanced in \nexperience and participation in public affairs to enable them to \nmanage their country on their own. \nThe Commission of Independence \nIn November 1918, the Philippine Legislature created the \nCommission of Independence “for the purpose of studying all \nmatters related to the negotiation and organization of the in¬ \ndependence of the Philippines.” The Commission was given “full \npower and jurisdiction to act for the Philippine Legislature and \nrepresent it in all respects during the recess of said Legislature.” \nIn March 1919, the Legislature approved a Declaration of Pur¬ \nposes for the guidance of the Commission. This declaration \nlaid down the task of the Commission, which was urged to work \nfor early independence to relieve “the anxiety of our people \nwhich two decades of occupation have only served to accentuate.” \nAs originally organized in 1918, the Commission was com¬ \nposed of eleven senators and forty congressmen, including the \npresiding officers of both houses of the Philippine Legislature, \nwho were to be its chairmen.

The most important undertaking \nof the Commission was the dispatch of independence missions \nto the United States and the direction of the publicity campaign \nfor independence. \nIndependence missions were sent largely through the initiative \nof the Nacionalista leaders in the legislature, with occasional \nDemocrata (the opposition minority party) participation to give \nthe campaign a semblance of national unity. Those who were \nprominently involved were Manuel L. Quezon, Sergio Osmena, \nManuel A. Roxas, Jose Abad Santos, Benigno Aquino, Sr., Camilo \nOsias, Elpidio Quirino, all Nacionalistas, and Claro M. Recto, \nEmilio Tria Tirona, Juan Sumulong, Pedro Gil, Ruperto Mon- \ntinola, all Democratas. \nThe missions presented a set argument in favor of their cause: \nthat independence was the great national ideal of the Filipino \npeople; that America had declared it her policy to withdraw \nher sovereignty over the Philippines and to recognize Philippine \nindependence as soon as a stable government had been established; \nthat a stable government managed and supported by the Filipinos \nthemselves had been established and that it could and would be \nmaintained by an independent Philippine government; and finally, \nthat the United States should fulfill its promise of independence. \nAlongside the missions, the Commission also conducted a \npublicity campaign in the United States, through the Philippine \nPress Bureau, established in Washington in April 1919. The pub¬ \nlicity campaign was aimed at developing the necessary interest in \nCongress and the American public to compel consideration of \nthe Philippine question, which admittedly received little pre¬ \nferential attention from Americans. A Press Bulletin was cir¬ \nculated in the United States until 1924, and American writers \nand publicists were hired to ‘‘advertise an entire people.” To \nfinance all these activities, the Philippine Legislature appro¬ \npriated what was, in view of the financial situation at the time, \nan extravagant sum — one million pesos annually — which could \nbe disbursed without necessity of pre-audit by the Insular Auditor. \nThe Independence Missions \nThe First Parliamentary Mission was sent to the United States \nin 1919, the only one during the Democratic Administration of"

The Mission \ncame at a bad time — the War had just ended and officials in \nWashington were more concerned with the problems of political \nand economic readjustments resulting from the War. Philippine \nindependence was thus farthest from their minds. \nThe Mission was received by Secretary of War, Newton D. \nBaker, in the absence of President Wilson, who was in Europe. \nBaker conveyed to them President Wilson’s reassuring encourage¬ \nment in favor of their petition, but there was no commitment \nto come to a final decision as to Philippine policy. Congres¬ \nsional committees concerned with Philippine affairs graciously \nheard the Mission’s petition for independence, but the Republican \nleaders in Congress were unconvinced that the Filipinos were \nready for independence and announced an indefinite postponement \nof the question of Philippine independence “until more convincing \nproof had been offered of the ability of the Filipino people to \nstand alone.” \nThe final action taken by Woodrow Wilson on behalf of the \nPhilippines was a recommendation to Congress in favor of Phil¬ \nippine independence — the only one he made in the eight years \nof his presidency, which, not surprisingly, the succeeding Repub¬ \nlican Administration ignored. \nFilipino hopes for any action on the Wilson recommendation \nhad dimmed considerably by the time of the inauguration, in \nMarch 1921, of Warren G.

The Mission had hoped to counteract the adverse con¬ \nclusions of the Report and to justify the political autonomy \ngranted the Filipinos by Governor Harrison. But more important¬ \nly, it had hoped to get a definitive statement on how and when \nthe Filipinos’ aspirations might be fulfilled, for the Report did \nnot spell these out. President Harding once again assured the \nMission that “no backward step is contemplated” but set forth the \nposition that independence at the time was out of the question. \nPresident Harding’s reply was disappointing to the Mission, \nbut it was not unexpected. After all, while awaiting the Pre¬ \nsident’s reply, in private conversations with General Frank Mc¬ \nIntyre, Chief of the Bureau of Insular Affairs of the War Depart¬ \nment [which directly supervised Philippine affairs], Quezon and \nOsmena had let it be known that despite their public utterances, \nthey did not expect any significant change in the status of the \nPhilippines “other than those which might be brought about \nunder the existing organic law.” Quezon and Osmena believed \nthat “the people of education and property in the Islands would \nbe satisfied and would for some years discontinue the discussion \nof independence if the government were made in local matters \npurely Filipino, v :th American control of foreign relations and \nrelations between the United States and the Islands.

The return of this delegation from \nthe United States was followed by an unusual degree of activity \nin support of independence. Confrontation rather than coopera¬ \ntion came to characterize the relations between the Filipino \nleadership and Governor Wood after the “Cabinet Crisis” in July \n1923. The Independence Commission successively sent independ¬ \nence missions to Washington in 1923,1924, and 1925. \nTo protest the alleged illegal and arbitrary acts of Governor \nWood, and specifically to ask for Wood’s relief or for Philippine \nindependence, a Special Mission led by the new Speaker of the \nHouse, Manuel A. Roxas, left for Washington in November 1923. \nIt presented a memorial listing Filipino grievances against the \nGovernor’s “reactionary and militaristic rule,” which “subverts \nthe moral foundations of the humanitarian wovk so nobly accom¬ \nplished by America in the Philippines.” \nPresident Calvin Coolidge delivered his reply to the memorial \nin a severe letter dated February 21, 1924. The President’s stand \nshattered the hopes of the Filipino Mission that the American \nGovernment would take measures in the near future to grant \nthe Filipinos their independence. Coolidge felt that inspite of \nthe progress made in the Philippines, the Filipinos were as yet un¬ \nprepared, financially and in other ways, to maintain their in¬ \ndependence, “for there had not been, thus far, a full realization \nof the fundamental ideas of democratic self-government.” \nCoolidge rebuked the Mission members especially for their \ncomplaints against Governor Wood. “Looking a+ the whole situa¬ \ntion fairly and impartially, one cannot but feel that if the Fihpino \npeople cannot cooperate in the support and encouragement \nof so good an administration as has been afforded under Governor \nGeneral Wood, their failure will be rather a testimony of un¬ \npreparedness for the full obligations of citizenship than an evid¬ \nence of patriotic eagerness to advance their country.” He assured \nthe Filipinos that the American people would gladly accord them \nindependence if it became apparent that it would be good for \nthem “from the point of view of both their domestic concerns"

Bills and resolutions for independence \nfrom Republicans and Democrats alike had been introduced be¬ \nfore in Congress but had seldom even received committee con¬ \nsideration until the 68th Congress. Committee hearings were \nheld thrice in this Congress, once each in the House and the \nSenate on the Cooper and King Bills, and once in the House on \nthe Fairfield Bill to increase autonomy for the Philippines. \nIn 1924 sentiment was strong in Congress to come to a so¬ \nlution to the Philippine problem. The congressional hearings \nrevealed that there was a growing feeling that the Filipinos should \nbe given what they said they wanted — immediate independence \n“at any cost” - letting the United States get the problem over \nwith quickly. The Fairfield Bill, an Administration alternative \nto the independence measures, was reported out of committee, \nand although it was never debated in Congress, it for a time \nseemed certain to pass. \nThe Administration, having concluded as hearings on the \nCooper and King measures progressed that the situation was get¬ \nting out of hand, had decided, in order to forestall the passage \nof independence legislation, to support a bill granting the Fi¬ \nlipinos complete insular autonomy. The Cooper measure having \nbeen sidetracked, the Fairfield Bill was introduced in April 1924 \nand was rushed through the House Committee on Insular Affairs \nwith unaccustomed speed, being voted out of committee on May \n10th. This was the same bill as prepared by the Bureau of Insular \nAffairs in 1922 at the confidential suggestion of Quezon and \nOsmena, then in Washington with the Parliamentary Mission. \nHaving sensed the drift in congressional attitudes as early \nas 1923, the Administration, through General McIntyre, had \nshown the bill to the Special Mission of Speaker Roxas in Decem¬ \nber 1923.

They are finding out that the \npeople who are most anxious to give them immediate independ¬ \nence are those interested in sugar, cigars, etc., in the American \nmarket and do not wish to continue the advantages to the Fili¬ \npinos which they are now receiving in the American market.” \nQuezon and Osmena, in Manila, realized that the Roxas \nMission had invited American withdrawal. When independence at \nlast appeared attainable, Quezon and Osmena, with Claro M. \nRecto (Democrata), decided to rush to Washington to oversee \nthe independence drive being pushed through Congress. The \nParliamentary Mission arrived in Washington in early May after \nthe Fairfield Bill had already been introduced in Congress and \ncommittee hearings were being held. \nThe bill, a precursor to the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act, pro¬ \nposed a thirty-year period of autonomy in which the Philippines \nwould have control of insular affairs, with an elective Governor \nGeneral for the “Commonwealth of the Philippines.” In its final \nform, the Fairfield Bill provided for absolute independence for \nthe Philippines in 1944, after a twenty-year commonwealth \nperiod. \nIn Washington, Quezon and Osmena made only a pro-forma \nbow in the direction of the Cooper Independence Bill and support¬ \ned the Fairfield Bill as the most reasonable legislation they could \nget from Congress. Though strong opposition was being expressed \nin the Philippines to the Fairfield Bill, they confidentially advised \nthe Administration that they could get the bill accepted if the \nAdministration would offer assurances that it would pass Congress. \nThe Administration rejected this scenario, however, stating that \nFilipino support must precede rather than follow any Adminis¬ \ntration commitment.

Immediately after the report was read, Recto \nvigorously denounced the report, declaring that what the majority \nleaders had done was actually the opposite: they supported the \nFairfield Bill and promised cooperation with Governor Wood \nupon their return. He filed a minority report which charged that \nthe Mission had been unwilling to press for independence when \nthe chance was there. \nRecto’s charges seriously embarrassed the majority leaders, \nwho vehemently insisted that they did not accept the Fairfield \nBill and had demanded immediate independence.

But on top of that, the funding of \nthe independence movement was severely curtailed by the decision \nof the Insular Auditor (an American) in 1924 to disallow the \none-million peso appropriation which financed the missions and \nthe publicity bureau in Washington. From this time on, the \nexpenses of the independence campaign came from “voluntary” \ncontributions and a smaller appropriation in the Legislature for \nsending “legislative committees” to the United States. \nIn spite of this discouraging state of affairs, insular politics \ndictated that the independence campaign had to continue, though \nthere was a marked change in tone. In August 1925, Osmena \nwent as a special envoy to Washington, ostensibly to confer with \nthe Washington government and Congress for the final solution of \nthe Philippine problem. In reality, Osmena went to look into \nthe possibility of some arrangement which would decrease the \nconfrontations with Wood and confirm what the Filipinos claimed \nwere certain commitments made by the Secretary of War in \nrelation to the Fairfield Bill. \nOsmena found the atmosphere in Washington generally hostile \nto any movement towards increased Philippine autonomy or inde¬ \npendence.

These \nwere measures designed to restrict Philippine autonomy by with¬ \ndrawing political powers already enjoyed by the Filipinos and \nstrengthening the hand of the Governor General. The only achieve¬ \nment Osmena took back to Manila with him was the defeat of \nthe reactionary measures which were being considered in Congress. \nOne of those reactionary bills was the Bacon Bill separating \nMindanao, Sulu, and Palawan from the jurisdiction of the Phil¬ \nippine Government and establishing for those regions a separate \nand distinct form of government directly under American so¬ \nvereignty. Separation of the Muslim territory from the Philip¬ \npine Government had actually been proposed as early as Novem¬ \nber 1923, when the American Chamber of Commerce of Mindanao \nand Sulu proposed that the area be made an unorganized territory \nunder the American flag. But no action had been taken at that \ntime. \nThe measure’s proponents claimed that their sole motive \nwas “to protect these defenseless and unarmed, though proud \nand self-respecting Moros.” Against the Bacon Bill the Filipinos \nregistered their most vigorous opposition. Some segments of \nthe Filipino population felt that the bill as inspired by the desire \nto effect a permanent occupation of the Philippines or a separa¬ \ntion of one of the larger islands for rubber production for Amer¬ \nican interests. Mindanao reportedly, had more than three million \nhectares of land suitable for rubber cultivation. The Filipinos \ndid not oppose the cultivation of rubber, but they insisted that \nforeign capital operate within existing Philippine laws. \nOne of the strongest arguments advanced for the Bacon Bill’s \ndivision of the Philippines into a Moro Province and a Christian \nNorth was that the Moros themselves were against independence \nand would prefer to remain under American sovereignty and \nprotection. To be sure, Muslim leaders had, at one time or an¬ \nother, addressed petitions to the Governor General and to Con¬ \ngress opposing independence for their territory and demanding \ncontinuation of American rule. However, it had been possible \nto secure from as many Muslims petitions proposing just the \nreverse — showing that they did not want to be separated from \nthe Christian Filipinos, but to receive independence with them."

There were \nsome, however, who felt that Quezon’s real motives were to \nstrengthen his hold on local affairs and leave him in more or less \nfull control. \nThe scheme of the Supreme National Council was theoretical¬ \nly quite impressive. Three objectives were advanced for the \nSupreme National Council: first, the attraction of substantial \nFilipinos not heretofore prominent in the independence campaign, \nwith the seeming subordination of the politico element which \nthus far had dominated it; second, the decentralization of the \ncampaign so that the provinces might take an active part, here¬ \ntofore played only by Manila; and third, an attempt at the gradual \nand peaceful use of the political authority vested in the American \nGovernor General and the Philippine Legislature. \nThe organizational structure established by the Council \nparalleled that of the insular government. National, provincial, \nand municipal “solidarity committees” were set up through¬ \nout the country, composed of all elective officials in each of \nthese jurisdictions. The Council sought to spread independence \npropaganda to prepare local government for complete independ¬ \nence in every province, town, and village of the Philippines. \nA closer look would reveal that the Supreme National Council \nwas really the Independence Commission under a different name, \nwith one interesting exception. The Council tried to play down \nthe role of the politicos in the campaign by inviting non-politicians \nto participate and thereby giving the appearance of a more nearly \nunanimous effort. But despite its elaborate structure and the \nseeming cooperation of various elements, political and otherwise, \nthe Supreme National Council was only of passing moment — \nbefore long it destroyed itself through its inability to reconcile \nthe disparate forces artificially brought together in the name of \nthe “national ideal” of independence."

By June 1927, the general impression was that the \nCouncil had little vitality left and by 1928 it had completely \nfaded away. \nThe Plebiscite Controversy \nAnother major disagreement between Governor Wood and the \nFilipino leaders concerned an independence plebiscite bill. The \nPhilippine Legislature initially passed the bill (Senate Bill 198), \nproviding for a plebiscite on immediate independence in early \nNovember 1925. Its purpose was to counteract the anti¬ \nindependence campaign in the United States premised on the \nassumption that, except for a small group of self-interested poli¬ \nticians, the Filipino people did not desire independence. The \nplebiscite was intended to show opponents of Philippine in¬ \ndependence in the United States that the struggle for national \nfreedom was not confined to a few but was supported by the \nmass of the Filipino people. \nThe plebiscite was not to be held. The Governor vetoed \nthe bill in December 1925 on the grounds that the calling of \na plebiscite was “not a matter within the scope of the legislative \npower granted under the organic act.” The bill was reintroduced \nand approved by the Philippine Legislature in July 1926. Wood \nagain vetoed the bill, but the Legislature reconsidered and re¬ \npassed the measure with the concurrence of more than two- \nthirds of its members. It then went to President Coolidge for \nfinal decision. \nIn April 1927, President Coolidge sustained the Governor’s \nveto of the plebiscite bill in a long message in which he stressed \nthe need for greater economic and political progress before such \nmatters as the holding of an independence plebiscite should be \nattended to. President Coolidge reviewed the various advantages, \nespecially economic, accruing to the Philippines as a result of \nthe current relationship with the United States, at the same \ntime pointing out the difficulties and problems which would be \nencountered by an independent Philippine government. The \nresult of the vote by the Filipino people would be unconvincing, \nhe advised, for it would not reflect the opinion of those Filipinos"

Quezon had a \nsobering admonition to his people. He said: . . we have taken \none more step forward in our onward march to the realization of \nour national ideal .... In this solemn moment, let there be no \nexultation of victory. Let it be a moment of consecration.” \nGoverning was now almost entirely a Filipino responsibility and \nQuezon must have taken stock of the conditions of the country \nand the people and realized that much work had not been done \nand much awaited the transition to independence. \nThe Framing of the Constitution \nIn accordance with the provisions of the independence act, \nthe Filipinos, on July 10, 1934, elected 202 delegations to a \nconstitutional convention tasked with the drafting of a Philip¬ \npine constitution. Meeting in inaugural convention on July 30, \nthe following were elected as officials of the constitutional con¬ \nvention: Claro M. Recto, president; Ruperto Montinola, first \nvice-president; Teodoro Sandiko, second vice-president; and \nNarciso Pimental, secretary. Forty committees were organized to \nstudy and report on the provisions of the constitution. A sub¬ \ncommittee of seven — the “seven wise men”.— prepared a draft \nof the constitution. They were Filemon Sotto, chairman, and \nNorberto Romualdez, Manuel Roxas, Vicente Singson Encarna- \ncion, Manuel C. Briones, Miguel Cuademo, and Conrado Benitez \n(who replaced Jose P. Laurel). \nThe Philippine Constitution followed the American model \nin structure and'formal appearance, except for a unicameral \nlegislature and a unitary (as against a federal) system of govern¬ \nment. The framers of the constitution were beneficiaries of the \nAmerican system of education and were, therefore, familiar \nwith American political concepts of democracy and government. \nNevertheless, the constitution reflected the historical experience \nof the Filipinos and included provisions such as the separation \nof church and state, and limitation on the size of agricultural \nlands to be owned by private individuals or corporations.

There were, \nthus, provisions for compulsory civil or military service and \ndeclarations to orient youth towards the ideals of civil efficiency. \nThe state was empowered to own and operate public utilities and \nenterprises and to regulate all employment relationships. The \nConstitution also vested extraordinary constitutional powers in \nthe President, including an item veto over appropriation, revenue, \nand tariff bills and conditional powers over trade and tariff. \n“In times of war or other national emergency,” Congress could \nauthorize him limitless critical powers. Historian Theodore \nFriend quoted one observer who thought the Philippine consti¬ \ntution “flexible enough to accommodate everything from a \nrepresentative republic to a temporary but renewable dictator¬ \nship.” Another observer thought that the likely scenario in \nthe Philippines would be “an irresponsible autocracy, with power \nconcentrated in the President, the Speaker, and to a much lesser \ndegree, in a few of their intimate political associates.” \nThe constitutional convention approved the constitution \non February 8, 1935 and President Roosevelt did the same on \nMarch 23. A plebiscite held on May 14, 1935 ratified the consti¬ \ntution. In September, a re-united Nacionalista Party (composed \nof the Quezon and Osmena-Roxas factions) won overwhelmingly \nover its rivals — General Emilio Aguinaldo and Bishop Gregorio \nAglipay. \nOn Friday, November 15, 1935, the Commonwealth of the \nPhilippines was inaugurated with Manuel L.

On the night of May 2-3, \n1935, 65,000 partially armed peasants shattered the tranquility \nof the countryside surrounding Manila. Between sunset and \nsunrise, peasant bands seized three communities and threatened \nten others in Bulacan, Rizal, Laguna, and Cavite. Throughout \nthe night, the confused situation escalated. Hard-pressed Consta¬ \nbulary units from the provinces and Manila fought with Sak- \ndalistas equipped with a motley array of weapons. There were \npersistent reports of an impending attack on Manila and recurrent \nand disturbing rumors of Japanese aircraft bringing in arms and \nammunitions for the rebels. Starting as an anti-Quezon, anti- \nNacionalista crusade, the Sakdalistas’ fiery leader, Benigno Ramos, \nbecame the persecuted spokesman for the oppressed masses. \nThe Sakdalistas organized their appeal around issues which \nhad tremendous appeal to the peasants. They accused the Nacio- \nnalistas of hypocrisy on the issue of independence and promised \nthat Ramos would acquire “complete and absolute” independence \nfor the Philippines by December 31, 1935. They also promised \nthat the Sakdal Party would abolish all taxes when it acquired \ncontrol of the government. Denouncing caciquism, they called \nfor equal or common ownership of land and proclaimed that \nall large holdings would be divided and distributed to the poor. \nThey also attacked the religious orders for operating vast estates \nand amassing wealth “through dishonest means.” \nThe Sakdal uprising demonstrated the extent of discontent \nin the provinces and the effectiveness of Sakdal appeal to address \ngiievances which had plagued the common tao for generations. \nIn fact, peasant and labor unrest had manifested themselves in a \nnew upsurge in the twenties in the face of grinding poverty, \nhigh taxes, usury, oppressive treatment by caciques, land-grabbing, \nfraudulent titling and other legel tricks employed by the rich and \nthe powerful.

While \nfor the most part American officials and Filipino politicians \ncontemptuously dismissed them as fanatical movements or plain \nbanditry, these movements reflected peasant grievances and \naspirations. \nEventually militant peasant and workers’ organizations arti¬ \nculated the grievances of the oppressed and downtrodden major¬ \nity who were mobilized for collective action. Labor and peasant \norganizations were radicalized through exposure to international \norganizations of the Left. The Communist Party of the Philip¬ \npines was formally established on November 7, 1930, but by \n1932, it had been declared an illegal organization, thus ending \nthe legal life of the CPP. \nSakdalism exerted a profound influence over the course of \nCommonwealth affairs.

To supplement the regular \ntraining program, preparatory military training (PMT) would be \ngiven in the elementary, high school and college levels. \nThe defense plan also included the establishment of a modest \nPhilippine navy to consist of 50-100 torpedo boats to be used \nprimarily for off-shore patrol. An Army Air Corps would be \ncomposed of a fleet of fast bomber planes. The defense plan \nwas not fully realized by the time war came to the Philippines. \nBudgetary constraints and the urgency of other important con¬ \ncerns, such as education, health and public works, necessarily \nlimited the capacity of General MacArthur to see his program \nthrough. \nThe Social Justice Program \nPerhaps no other Commonwealth policy has received as much \nattention, curiosity, and even, criticism, as Quezon’s social justice \nprogram. The Constitution of 1935 mandated that “the pro¬ \nmotion of social justice to insure the well-being and economic \nsecurity of all the people should be the concern of the state.” \nSocial justice was equated with justice to the common man. \nThis meant the improvement of the lot of the tao by emancipating \nhim from those conditions that make it possible for the rich \nand powerful to take advantage of him. This was to be achieved \nby protecting the tao from exploitation by seeing to it that he \ngot what was rightly due him — fair treatment, proper living and \nworking conditions, and just compensation for his labors. In \nthe light of the Sakdal uprising, Quezon had to commit himself \nand his Nacionalista Party to a platform that emphasized justice \nfor the tao. “If we are just to our people, we will be free from \ninternal rebellion,” he had been heard to say. He saw clearly \nthe contentment of the tao as the first insurance against social \nand political disorders. \nQuezon was blessed with a few fortuitous circumstances in \ninitiating his social justice program.

Through the Assembly, Quezon was able to obtain \nnecessary legislation, and through executive orders and procla¬ \nmations, he organized advisory and administrative bodies, councils \nand courts that were necessary to handle problems as they arose. \nOn two important fronts, reforms were instituted: labor \nand tenancy. Commonwealth Act No. 211 (November 1936) \nestablished a minimum wage for laborers employed in public \nworks projects. (This was PI.00 a day, the amount subsequently \nraised to PI.25.) The eight-hour labor law was also passed, ap¬ \nplicable to persons employed in any public or private industry \nor occupation. Commonwealth Act No. 213 sought to recognize, \ndefine, and regulate legitimate labor disputes and a Court of \nIndustrial Relations was established to settle between employers \nand laborers questions involving hours of labor, minimum wages, \nworking conditions and other matters affecting their relations. \nOn the tenancy front, it was part of Quezon’s social justice \nprogram that some kind of land reform be started. He planned \nthat the big estates would disappear within 15 to 20 years after \nthe establishment of the Commonwealth and the tillers of the \nsoil would subsequently own the lands they cultivated. Quezon \nlamented the fact that “The men and women who till the soil \nand work in the factories are hardly better off now than they \nwere during the Spanish regime.” Quezon, however, emphasized \nthat social justice required that the government respect the right \nof owners to their property and that of the landed to their land; \nit could not wrest those lands away from their legal owners \nfor sale to the workers without due payment. \nRealizing that urgent reforms were needed in the rice and \nsugar sectors of the economy, the National Rice and Com Cor¬ \nporation was created in December 1935 to stabilize the price of \nrice with the aim of protecting producer and consumer and to \nserve as an agency of the government to meet local or national \nemergencies in case of a rice shortage. A National Sugar Board \nwas likewise created to conduct a survey of the sugar industry \nand to assist the government in its efforts to solve the social \nproblems confronting the country. To avert the possibility of \nthe monopoly of land by a few, an Agricultural and Industrial \nBank and farmers cooperatives were established to afford easier \nterms in applying for and acquiring homesteads and other farm \nlands. The government believed that it should not stop at the"

Quezon \nwas also able to lease haciendas from their owners for a period \nnot exceeding 25 years, with an option for tenants to purchase \nthe land during that period, for a specified price. These pro¬ \njects were undertaken in Cagayan, Bohol, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija \nand Pampanga, areas prone to agrarian restiveness. \nRealizing that in times of calamities the unemployed and \nindigent suffered the most, the National Relief Administration \nwas created (January 1938) to coordinate under its sole manage¬ \nment the different relief activities of the government with those \nbeing undertaken by private relief institutions. \nThe success of Quezon’s admittedly far-reaching and humane \npolicies was limited by the availability of funds, clashes between \ncapital and labor, and difficulties in the enforcement of laws. \nParliamentary victories in Manila did not add up to alleviation of \nmisery in the towns and barrios. Provincial governors and local \nauthorities blocked the application of social justice. Quezon’s \npersistent and determined efforts notwithstanding, effective means \nfor implementing the program at the barrio level were never \nattained. \nMuch of Quezon’s difficulty came from cacique determina¬ \ntions to maintain the status quo. Caciques, fearing that their days \nof power and wealth were numbered, organized landlord associa¬ \ntions (like Batung Maputi in Pampanga in the late 20s), private \narmies and cooperative efforts to restrict the activities of peasant \nmovements (for example, the National Volunteers organized by \nthe Governor of Cavite and Carnal ning Capayapaan organized by \nthe Governor of Pampanga). Provincial councils passed laws to \nrestrict peasant political activity and hacenderos did everything \nin their power to strengthen municipal law enforcement agencies \nin their favor. \nThe tenancy problem threatened to undermine the entire \nsocial structure. It v~s not the number of tenants, which had \ndoubled by 1935, but the conditions of tenancy that mattered. \nThe tenancy law governing tenant-landlord relations could be \ncircumvented by a loophole provision that the law would take \neffect only when the municipal council passed a resolution making"

Members of the \nmunicipal councils were themselves landlords or political proteges \nof landlords. Thus the law was rendered ineffective and there was \nlittle done to improve the living and working conditions of the \ntenants tied to their landlords in oppressive feudal relations. \nOn the labor front, the Department of Labor was always \nshort of personnel during much of the Commonwealth that it \nfound itself unable to make the necessary inspection of mines \nand factories to insure safety regulations. There were also flagrant \nexploitation of child labor. The Labor Arbitration Act was \nself-defeating and impotent as conflicting parties were unable \nto enter into peaceful arbitration of disputes. \nQuezon’s social justice program had its pitfalls due to the \ncontradictions between theory and practice. Absentee land¬ \nlords and abusive administrators made a mockerly of laws seeking \nto alleviate the lot of the peasants and tenants. Quezon’s govern¬ \nment was often forced to make a choice between the interests \nof capital and those of labor. Quezon was sympathetic to the \nneeds and aspirations of those who worked for a living but he \nwas also prey to the influence of powerful blocs. His Cabinet \nand the Legislature were hacendero-dominated, and Quezon’s \nreliance upon extremely conservative men of wealth to support \nhis party and personal projects limited his social justice pro¬ \ngram. He was unable to win for his enlightened policies a major¬ \nity of those who wielded economic and political power. \nIn general, the social justice program did not prove an out¬ \nstanding success as it depended almost entirely on the personality \nof Quezon. There was no guarantee that his successors would \ncontinue to pursue the program or thwart its aims. Quezon’s \nefforts varied from the enactment of various laws, the creation \nof government agencies, the enforcement of a minimum daily \nwage in public works projects, and the creation of the Rural \nProgress Administration (in March 1939). What he sought was to \nimprove the lot of the masses of Filipinos to correct the injus¬ \ntices they have suffered through the years. The actual results \nwere meager. He lacked enough money and a sufficiently honest \nand independent civil service to counteract the means of sabotage \nused by the powerful landed and sectional interests against his \nsocial justice program. \nBy 1940, the whole of Central Luzon was in turmoil — there \nwas widespread peasant unrest there and in the Visayas and"

The provincial atmosphere was heavy with class \ntension in the years leading up to Pearl Harbor, with caciques \norganizing private armies in efforts to restrict the activities of \npeasant movements and agrarian leaders seeking more effective \nmeans to organize the rural population. \nEducation during the Commonwealth \nSocial justice was also linked to the need to improve the \nskills, productivity and development of the human resources \nof the nation. This could be achieved through the development \nof a system of education that would be available to the largest \nnumber of Filipinos. The Commonwealth government placed a \nhigh premium on the promotion of democratization of educa¬ \ntional opportunities, working on the assumption that education \nof the citizenry was crucial in the success of democratic self- \ngovernment in the Philippines. \nThus Quezon emphasized that one of his goals would be to \neradicate illiteracy by giving every Filipino child at least a modem \nelementary education so that in time a body of trained and \neducated citizens might provide the leadership of the future na¬ \ntion. To overseer the reform of the educational system to make \nit better conform to the requirements of their new political \nstatus and the future of the country, a National Council of Edu¬ \ncation was created in 1936, chaired by Rafael Palma, and Vice \nPresident Osmena headed the Department of Education, the \nfirst time a Filipino assumed that position. The main emphasis \nduring the early years of the Commonwealth was on primary and \nadult education. With the elimination of the seventh grade and \nthe institution of a double-single session, enrollment in the pri¬ \nmary schools increased. \nThe objective of universal primary education was not at¬ \ntained. The rate of population increase just could not keep \nup with the facilities. In 1935, 1,229,242 children were en¬ \nrolled in public schools; in 1939, 1,961,861 were enrolled. Only \n45% of children of school age were enrolled in public schools. \nAnother aspect of educational policy was the relation of \nthe school curriculum to national needs.

The idea was \nto produce textbooks better adapted to the interests of the \nFilipino child — “more interpretive of the national spirit and \nthe desires of the people.” By 1940, Quezon realized that the \nsystem of elementary instruction in the schools had yet to be \nadapted to the needs of Filipino society. A great deal of money \nhad been spent without producing tangible results, with Filipinos \ncoming out of the schools practically illiterate. The National \nAssembly thus embarked upon a complete revision of the public \nelementary school system and institutionalized the principle of \nuniversal compulsory education through the primary grades. \nAside from stressing the equality of opportunity in educa¬ \ntion as one of its goals, the Commonwealth government also \nused the schools to produce skills and dignify labor. All school \nchildren were required to take some vocational courses that \nrequired them to work with their hands — basket-making, car¬ \npentry, blacksmithing, gardening, raising stock, sewing, cooking, \nhousekeeping, etc. In addition there were farm settlement schools, \nagricultural high schools, trade and rural high schools, and event¬ \nually, a school of arts and trades and a nautical school. \nIn general vocational schools did not become popular as most \nFilipino families preferred academic schooling for two reasons: \nfirst, the difficulty of finding employment in the vocations; and, \nsecond, because manual labor, even of the skilled varities, was \nnot held in high esteem. \nThe Commonwealth government also provided for adult \neducation. In 1939, nearly V2 of the population over 10-years of \nage were reported illiterate. The objectives of adult education, \nsupervised by the Office of Adult Education of the Department \nof Public Instruction, were to eliminate illiteracy and to give \nvocational and citizenship training. By 1940, more than 6,000 \nadult schools had been established, manned by some 50,000 \nvolunteers devoted to the campaign against illiteracy. \nQuezon’s dream of building a literate society was realized \nin parts of the country (by 1938, literacy was measured at 48.8% \nfor children aged 10 and above; in Manila, 80.7% of the people \nwere reported literate), but the hope of eradicating poverty \nthrough education was unfulfilled. There were not enough schools \nto accommodate everyone, and not all those who made it through \nthe elementary grades made it to high school. Children of lower \nincome groups could not always afford the cost of education."

Strangely, too, the increase in the number of educa¬ \ntional institutions offering higher education was accompanied \nby a corresponding decline in the quality of education. \nThe National Language \nArticle 2 of the Constitution directed the National Assembly \nto “take steps toward the development and adoption of a com¬ \nmon language based on one of the existing native languages.” \nQuezon thought that a national language would foster national \nunity and national identity. On November 13, 1936, the Na¬ \ntional Assembly enacted Commonwealth Act No. 184 establish¬ \ning the Institute of National Language tasked to study the dif¬ \nferent Philippine languages for the purpose of evolving and adopt¬ \ning a national language. \nOn November 9, 1937, after serious consideration, the \nInstitute of National Language recommended the adoption of \nTagalog as the basis of the national language. On December 30, \nQuezon proclaimed the language based on Tagalog as the coun¬ \ntry's national language. In April 1940, Quezon authorized the \nprinting of a dictionary and grammar prepared by the Institute. \nBeginning on June 19, 1940, the national language was ordered \ntaught in all schools in the Philippines. Through Commonwealth \nAct No. 570, the National Assembly declared that the Tagalog- \nbased national language would become one of the official lan¬ \nguages of the country effective upon independence on July 4, \n1946. \nEconomic Development \nThe other major concern of the Commonwealth Government \nwas economic development. A sound economic system would un¬ \ndoubtedly insure the political independence of the country in \nsubstance as well as in form, while it also provided the govern¬ \nment with the wherewithal to provide for the well-being and \nprosperity of its people. It is probably fair to assume that one \nof Quezon’s nightmares when he assumed the presidency was \nthe problem of economic adjustment of an independent Philip¬ \npines which has had several decades of economic dependence on \nthe United States.

These \nwere not only American and Spanish, but Chinese and Japanese \nas well, who played significant roles in the economic affairs \nof the country. So what kind of independence would be afford¬ \ned the Filipinos if they were a minor factor in the management \nof their economic resources? \nThe economic trend during the Commonwealth period was \nslow and uneven development. There were sectors that were \nstrong and well-developed. Agriculture was the most important \nsector of the Philippine economy, providing employment for \n65% of the labor force and contributing about 40% of the na¬ \ntional income and 75% of the value of exports. It was, however, \npredominantly export agriculture, producing crops geared to the \nAmerican market — sugar, coconut, tobacco and abaca. Yet while \nexport agriculture flourished, the lives of the great mass of Fili¬ \npinos remained dismal. \nOther sectors of the agricultural economy did not fare so \nwell. The emphasis on production for the export market was \nso great that the Philippines, potentially one of the great food- \nsurplus-producing areas in Asia, became one of the major food \ndeficit areas. American economic policy obviously ignored \nthe long-range problem of developing Philippine agricutlure and \nimproving the agrarian situation. The agrarian problem raised \nthe more fundamental questions of political stability and econo¬ \nmic progress. \nAnd finally, industrialization was at an extremely low level. \nFilipino capital was no match to foreign capital. \nThere was, thus, a need to build some sectors of the economy, \nwhile the whole economic and social structure needed re¬ \nstructuring to better serve the needs of the people and the country. \nTrade Relations with the United States \nThe most pressing economic problem involved trade rela¬ \ntions with the United States. In the years before the estab¬ \nlishment of the Commonwealth, Philippine economy had be¬ \ncome tied to the American market. Sales of Philippine products \nto the United States increased enormously because of free trade \nwhile sales to foreign countries had, in the 1930s, become less \nthan what they were at the beginning of the decade.

Under the Tydings-McDuffie Act \nof 1934, this arrangement was to continue for five years, then \nfor five years 5% of the appropriate tariffs would be levied each \nyear against Philippine products so that in the last year of the \nCommonwealth, in 1945-1946, 25% of the American tariff would \nbe in force on each item entering the United States. With com¬ \nplete independence in 1946, “a brutal leap” to full tariff would \nbe applied to Philippine exports to the United States, During \nthe ten-year transition period there would be no reciprocal limits \nor duties on American products entering the Philippines - “a \nshocking inequality,” as some would say. “An appalling indif¬ \nference to Philippine welfare,” overshadowed the “nobility” \nof the political provisions of the Tydings-McDuffie Act! \nThe strong trend toward the growth of the export economy \nduring the American occupation had some serious effects on the \nsocio-economic situation of the country. The granting of free \ntrade preferences to Philippine exports after 1909 stimulated \nthe production of cash crops for export to the United States. \nAt the same time, it gave to American manufactured imports a \ncompetitive advantage which led to the decline of Philippine \nhandicrafts, an important element in the agricultural economy. \nThis led to the emergence of a “colonial type national economy,” \nheavily dependent on agricultural raw material exports and on \nmanufactured and processed goods as well as food imports. \nIdeally, American and Filipino leadership should have worked \nduring the years before 1934 to develop new capital-forming \nindustries in the Philippines that would not compete with busi¬ \nness in the United States. Instead, because of the free trade rela¬ \ntionship, the economy of the Philippines remained tied to the \nUnited States. Once the Tydings-McDuffie Act became law, \nAmerican and Filipino businessmen continuously pointed out \nthat the ten-year transition period was too short to permit the \nnecessary basic restructuring of the Philippine economy — i.e., \ndevelop alternative sources of revenue, diversify agricultural \nproduction and seek new market outlets for Philippine products. \nLoss of the American market, or even a serious curtailment once \nthe tariffs went into effect, would mean a paralyzing and deva¬ \nstating blow to the United States.

The Com¬ \nmittee recommended that upon independence, instead of the \n“brutal leap” to complete separation, there would begin a 15-year \nperiod in which decreasing duty-free quotas would be substituted \nfor increasing export taxes on most products. For sugar and \nabaca, there would be a prdgressive decline in tariff preferences. \n(Total dissociation would take place in 1960.) American pro¬ \nducts entering the Philippines were to be subject to reciprocal \ntariff, likewise graduating toward 100%. In August 1940, the \nPhilippine Economic Adjustment Act (also called the Tydings- \nKocialkowski Act) was passed, which removed the increase in \nexport tax which would have been applied from 1949 on Philip¬ \npine coconut oil, cigars, embroideries and pearly buttons exported \nto the United States, substituting instead a declining duty-free \nquota for each product. \n\\ ... ■' i ■ ■. y-> ’ \nPhilippine Independence Re-Examined \nSince the United States was not inclined to tinker with the \npolitical status of the Philippines, Quezon decided to test the \nwaters. \nIn early 1937, Quezon stated that he wanted the date of \nPhilippine independence advanced to late 1938 or early 1939. \nIn declaring this, Quezon was admitting that independence was \nimpractical and was looking for dominion status, perhaps think¬ \ning that that was the answer to the problems of economic adjust¬ \nment. The economic relations then prevailing were intolerable \nsince the United States could make changes almost at will to \nsuit American interests, with the Philippines unable to defend \nits economic interests because of its political status. Quezon \nworried about congressional tinkering with the Tydings-McDuffie \nAct and felt that Philippine' Amcriean relations would be best \nstabilized by a treaty between two sovereign powers. Quezon’s \nattempts to secure beneficial modifications of the Tydings-Mc¬ \nDuffie Act gave widespread publicity to the economic realities \nfacing the Philippines that it would be better for the United States \nto retain the Philippines indefinitely — if the United States would \nhave them.

The \nre-examination of Philippine independence was not received well \nby the Filipinos, so Quezon backed off from suggestions for post¬ \nponement or abandonment of independence in 1946. Instead \nhe advised his people to prepare for it and “move forward firmly \nand courageously to achieve our long-cherished ideal — the estab¬ \nlishment of the Philippine Republic — and to secure for our people \nprospeiity, happiness and freedom under the shelter of peace and \ndemocracy.” \nIt has been said that American policy was insensitive to \nthe emerging problem of economic development. Be that as it \nmay, some of the blame for the stagnancy during the transition \nperiod must rest with Philippine enterprise and with the Com¬ \nmonwealth government. Philippine businessmen tended to seek \ntraae preferences rather than to change methods of production \nand marketing, or to diversify their endeavors. They preferred \nto cling to the artificial sustenance of the American market. \nThe Commonwealth period enjoyed one of the earliest, \ngenuine possibilities for economic decolonization, but in those / \nyears, from 1935 to the outbreak of the war in 1941, there was \nlittle economic development externally stimulated or domestic¬ \nally sought. The failure to meet economic problems was partly a \nresult of military considerations. The military commanded 22% \nof the Philippine national budget and that and other concerns \ndrained the Philippine economy. Further, Americans underesti¬ \nmated the economic dependence into which they had led the \nFilipinos. \nBy 1940, the colonial type export-import economy had \ndeveloped to such a degree that the proceeds from the agricul¬ \ntural export crops amounted to approximately 1/3 of the total \nnational income. It was estimated that no less than 6 million \nout of the total population of 16 million were dependent on \nthe cash crop export commodities for their livelihood.

Aside from \nthe Americans, the Chinese and Japanese also exercised tre¬ \nmendous control over certain sectors of the economy. The \nChinese controlled 75-82% of retail trade and operated credit \nfacilities, directed and financed the production of rice and other \nstaples, as well as tobacco, hemp and copra. They also invested \nin the logging and timber industry, manufacturing, banking and \nreal state. Japanese activity in the Philippines increased with the \ninauguration of the Commonwealth and the waning of the De¬ \npression. In 1934, the Japanese, for the first time, displaced the \nUnited States as the chief seller of cotton piece goods in the \nPhilippines. They also desired an expanding role in the internal \neconomic development of the Philippines — such as in retail \nbusiness, fishing, mining, lumbering, some extractive industries \nand manufacturing. In 1939, Japanese immigrants exceeded the \nChinese for the first time in Philippine history. They were very \nevident in Manila, and Davao was practically a Japanese colony. \nQuezon’s solution to the foreign domination of the Philippine \neconomy was to call for economic nationalism. An Anti-Dummy \nLaw was passed in May 1939 which punished Filipinos who allow¬ \ned themselves to be used as “dummies” or fronts by alien busi¬ \nnessmen and investors. In May 1940, an Immigration Law limited \nto 500 the number of quota immigrants permitted annually \nto enter the Philippines. Credit facilities through the National \nCredit Corporation encouraged Filipinos to engage in retail trade. \nThe National Economic Protectionism Association (NEPA) \ndeveloped Filipino preference for products grown or produced \nin the Philippines, thus making them less dependent on Amer¬ \nican goods. In 1936, the Manila Trading Center distributed \nproducts to more than 400 small manufacturers and merchants \nthrough the Manila Carnival, provincial and municipal fairs and \nexpositions, and provincial trading centers. In 1938, the Key \nto Economic Nationalism, or KENA concept, was launched, aimed \nat promoting Filipino participation in domestic trade and com-"

To check further \nadvance of Japanese business in Davao, a broad program for the \ndevelopment of Mindanao was undertaken. Large tracts of land \nwere opened as colonization sites for settlement projects, in \nCotabato, Agusan and Davao. Quezon stressed that one of the \naims of his administration was to grant Filipinos every facility that \nthey needed to acquire an increasing share in business and econo¬ \nmic activities. \nAside from the problem areas, the Commonwealth government \nalso turned its attention to the development of the total economy. \nQuezon promised to promote economic development, in parti¬ \ncular, the establishment of basic industries and other industries, \nnot only to provide employment but also to bring the country \ncloser to economic sufficiency. He also pledged to aid agriculture, \npromote cooperatives, effect a coordination of transportation, \nsuppress “cut-throat” competition, ensure that the rates charged \nby public utilities were reasonable, reduce the interest rate and \nprovide tariff protection for local industries. \nQuezon was anxious to restore to the agricultural sector \nthe attention it deserved. His government was keen to diversify \n•the agricultural economy so as to rectify dependence on sugar \nand tobacco, which were subject to the vagaries of the American \nmarket and tariff changes. Hence attention was directed to the \ncultivation of onions, cotton and rubber. Small industries to \nsupply the domestic market were also encouraged, such as cotton \nspinning, soap-making and production of foodstuffs. \nIndustrialization, which was at an extremely low level, was \nattempted, for it was thought that it would raise the standard \nof living of the people if prices of several necessities were reduced \nand it would help secure for Filipinos the wages and profits \nwhich were going to American factory-owners and workers. \nTo overcome the problems which hindered extensive industrial¬ \nization, the government, through the National Power Corporation, \nexploited the hydro-electric resources of the country (such as \nthe Caliraya River Project), undertook research and development \nof some industries to determine what would be profitable, and \nextended transportation and communication facilities. \nOne gets the impression that Quezon had a hand in the \nminutest details of the planning of the economy.

He believed \nin a state-directed economic system since government was in the \nbest position to provide the degree of economic stimulation that \nwas needed to meet the problems of an independent nation. This \nwas no surprise as Quezon operated pretty much the same way \nwith his political philosophy. In March 1936, the National Eco¬ \nnomic Council was created to direct the economic activities of \nthe Commonwealth. \ni \n“Partyless Democracy” \nThe Philippine Commonwealth was a “Quezon government,” \nwith Quezon clearly dominating political life (sometimes even \nshrewdly administering by radiophone from halfway around the \nworld!) and the National Assembly almost totally submissive to \nhis domination. Quezon was clearly the most dynamic personality \nof the pre-war era and exemplified the “modem lawyer-politician” \nso characteristic of the political leadership of contemporary \nPhilippines. He was the progenitor of a system of politics and \na style of leadership that has left an indelible imprint on the \nPhilippine polity. During the Commonwealth, a system of \n“clientelist politics” that had been * evolving for almost half a \ncentury was institutionalized and perfected. As Commonwealth \nPresident, Quezon perfected a patronage system he had used as \nSenate President (from 1916-1935) to establish his dominance \nover Philippine politics. This was an inter-related and finely-tuned \nsystem that stretched from the barrio to Malacanang, and even \nto Washington. \nQuezon devoted considerable energies to the mastery of \nprovincial rivalries through intervention and manipulation of \nthe disposition of patronage. He controlled the legislature and \npoliticians became subservient to him through “mollification, \ncoalition and fusion.” By 1941, on the eve of the war, he had \neliminated all elite opposition within and without the Nacionalista \nParty and could announce a theory of “partyless democracy.” \n“Opposition parties” and “individual liberties” were to demo¬ \ncratic “fetishes” that must be discarded, he intoned. In sum, he \nhad shaped the written and unwritten constitution, set the standard \nof executive leadership, forged the terms of post-independence \nrelations with the United States, fashioned a close link between \nprovincial and national politics, and selected the next generation \nof political leaders."

This “trend toward totalitarianism” during the \nCommonwealth alarmed the American High Commissioners and \nWashington was duly warned. “The Filipinos have to do their \nown thinking and learn from contemporary lessons or ‘bust’,” \nQuezon explained, and then proceeded to tell High Commissioner \nFrancis Sayre to mind his own business. \nQuezon did not see his own primacy and increasing power as \na problem to his people: “the good of the state, not the good of \nthe individual, must prevail.” The failure of the country’s leader¬ \nship to provide a balanced party system and to correct the un¬ \neven distribution of power in the government resulted in the \ncontinuing dominance of an “irresponsible autocracy” which \nfurther aggravated the plight of the “unrepresented minorities.” \nIn a lot of ways, the Commonwealth era had been stagnant; \nthe post-war years of the Republic were the true years of tran¬ \nsition to independence.

The policy, while \nnot satisfactory enough from the point of view of the Filipino \nnationalist, was nevertheless a decided improvement over that \nof Spain. Universal education was stressed; public health and \nwelfare was carried to the remote barrios; commerce, industry, \nand trade were given impetus; basic individual freedoms were \nrespected; means of communication and transportation were \ngreatly improved; and political consciousness was developed \nthrough the introduction of American political institutions and \npractices. Side by side with these positive results of the American \noccupation were the negative results: the general economic \ndependence on the United States, the partial loss of the racial \nheritage, the continuance of the colonial mentality, and a \ndistorted sense of values. \nProgress in Education.“ The greatest contribution of the \nUnited States to Philippine civilization is the system of public \neducation. Directly opposed to the Spanish system which em¬ \nphasized, on one hand, the study of the Catholic religion, and \non the other, the employment of the Philippine languages rather \nthan Spanish as pedagogical aid* the American educational \nsystem emphasized the democratic traditions and the practical \napplication of laws and principles. It is not, however, assumed \nthat the American system was hostile to religion, but that this \nsubject was optional rather than compulsory. The relegation \nof religion to the optional category was based on the principle \nof the separation of Church and State, under which the Church \nhad no say in running the public school system. \nUnlike the practice of the Spanish authorities in the Philip¬ \npines of discouraging the Filipinos from learning Spanish, the \n* Spanish was taught only to a few; the teaching of Spanish started in \nthe second half of the nineteenth century. \n371"

American schools were \nimmediately established soon after the echoes of Dewey’s naval \nguns had vanished. Seven such schools were established in Ma¬ \nnila in August 1898 and many more were opened as the condi¬ \ntion of peace and order permitted. By 1899-1900, the primary \nschools enrolled more than 100,000 Filipino children of school \nage. Enrollment of children in the public schools was compul¬ \nsory, and to encourage parents to send their children to schools \nthe American authorities gave the students free books, pencils, \nand other school supplies. The first public school teachers were \nthe American soldiers who were later on replaced by the “Tho- \nmasites,” that is, the American teachers who came to the Philip¬ \npines on board the S. S. Thomas. From 1903 to 1914, Fili¬ \npino students who showed aptitudes in some branches of learn¬ \ning were sent to the United States as pensionados. Upon their \nreturn, they either taught school or worked in government of¬ \nfices. Thus the American system prepared the Filipino not only \nfor teaching, but also for administrative service, an asset in the \nFilipinization of the government. \nHigher education was provided by the establishment of the \nstate-supported University of the Philippines in 1908. Other \neducational institutions, owned and operated by private individ¬ \nuals or corporations, were established to slake the Filipinos’ \nthirst for knowledge. Some of these institutions, like the Uni¬ \nversity of Sto. Thomas, the Escuela de Derecho (School of Law), \nthe Institute Burgos (Burgos Institute) and others, continued \nto use Spanish as the medium of instruction, but the pressure \nof competition forced them to abandon Spanish in favor of Eng¬ \nlish. Their graduates, who had very little acquaintance, if at \nall, with the English language were greatly handicapped in govern¬ \nment examinations, which were conducted in English. Thus, \nEnglish came to be the language of instruction in all schools, \ncolleges and universities — a fact which explains why English \nis understood throughout the Philippines. \nThe net result of such a system was the increase of Filipino \nliteracy. There are no reliable data to show the percentage of \nliteracy at the close of the Spanish period, but it is probably \nsafe to assume that the figure was somewhere between 5% and \n8%.

Adult \neducation was experimented by American missionaries in the \nnon-Christian areas from the early years of the American occu¬ \npation, but it was not until about 1933 that adult education \nbecame a movement. The University of the Philippines pioneered \nin that vast undertaking when some of its professors and students, \naided by adult education experts, launched a campaign of literacy \nin the rural areas. \nPublic Health and Welfare.—Next in importance to the public \neducational system as America’s contribution to Philippine civil¬ \nization was the introduction of a scientific program of public \nhealth and welfare. Before 1900, ravages of cholera, smallpox, \ndysentery, malaria, tuberculosis, and other deadly diseases, \nplagued the people. While it is true that the Spanish colonial \ngovernment introduced vaccination and created offices, such as \nthe Bureau of Health (1806) and the Central Council of Vacci¬ \nnation (1851), to guard the health of the people, yet because \nof inefficiency and/or incompetence of the colonial officials the \ngood intentions of the government were frustrated. Public and \nprivate sanitation and hygiene were far from satisfactory so \nthat mortality was high. When the Americans came, they im¬ \nmediately set to work to minimize the spread of diseases and \nto improve, on the other hand, the health of the people. Epi¬ \ndemics that used to migrate to the Philippines were either pre¬ \nvented or minimized by the establishment of the Quarantine \nService supervised by competent American doctors and public \nhealth officers. \nInfant mortality and the incidence of malaria and other dis¬ \neases were reduced considerably by the introduction of new \nmethods of prevention and treatment and by educating the peo¬ \nple in the elementary principles of hygiene and sanitation. The \ntask, the American doctors found out, was difficult, for the Fili¬ \npinos, superstition-ridden and ignorant of the strange power of \nthe minute germs to cause deadly diseases, were not easily con¬ \nvinced by the efficacy of medical methods in combating the \ncauses of death from various sicknesses. The early Americans, \nthen, were up against a formidable wall of ignorance and super¬ \nstition which made the task of public health improvement dif¬ \nficult."

Field men were sent to \nthe provinces to explain the workings of modem sanitation and \nhygiene. Dispensaries, leprosaria, and hospitals were established \nto take care of sick and infected people. The American contri¬ \nbution to Filipino health may be gleaned from the fact that in \n1898 the death rate per 1,000 persons was 30.5%, while in 1907 \nit slumped to 21.29%. Except in 1917-1918, when cholera \nand smallpox epidemics broke out, the mortality per 1,000 \npersons progressively diminished in succeeding years. \nAt the same time that the Americans were battling diseases, \nignorance and superstition they were also providing facilities \nfor the release of human misery and misfortune. Asylums for \nthe orphans, the insane, and the juvenile offenders were found¬ \ned. A new attitude was thus created for the welfare of these \nunfortunates who, in the past, might have been allowed to en¬ \ndanger society or might have been imprisoned without giving \nthem the chance to survive in a brutal society . The vocational \ntraining given to the orphans and the juvenile delinquents re¬ \nsulted in their moral and physical rehabilitation. Interest in \npublic welfare was awakened among the people and a new pub¬ \nlic philosophy was bom to replace that of apathy and indifference. \nThe result of the development of health and welfare may \nbe seen not only in decreased mortality, but more so in the im¬ \nprovement of the standard of living. The salt-and-rice nutrition \nwas replaced by a balanced diet which, in turn, resulted in phy¬ \nsical robustness. At the turn of the century, the average Fili¬ \npino height measured somewhere between 5’2” and 5’4”, but \nwith improved diet, exercise, and sports the height increased \nto between 5’4” and 5’6”. \nTrade, Commerce, and Industry .—The economic develop¬ \nment of the Philippines under the United States may be attribut¬ \ned to the free trade relations that the Americans imposed upon \nthe country.

Under this Act, all Philippine \nexports, except rice, were allowed to enter American markets \nfree of duty within certain quota limits. On the other hand, \nAmerican exports to the Philippines were unlimited and duty¬ \nfree. To correct the inequality in the law, the American Cong¬ \nress passed the Simmons-Underwood Tariff Act in 1913 which \nabolished the quota limitations on Philippine export products \nlike hemp, sugar, and tobacco. \nThe result of these free trade relations with the United States \nwas that Philippine foreign trade rose to unheard-of proportions. \nStatistics show that from 1900 to 1909, before the Payne-Aldrich \nTariff Act was passed, the average annual export of the Philippines \namounted to 60.9 million pesos; this figure increased to 94.7 \nmillions in 1910-1914; to 177.3 millions in 1914-1918,* to 234.7 \nmillions in 1919-1924, to 297.9 millions in 1925-1930; and \ndecreased to 213.2 millions in 1930-1935. The reason for the \ndecrease in 1930-1935 was the world-wide economic depression. \nExcept during the period of the first World War, 1914-1918, \nthe Philippines always had a favorable balance of trade. \nDomestic trade likewise developed. In 1917, the gross mer¬ \nchants’ sales was P400,197,966, but in 1935 it rose to P631,614,- \n000. Comparing the growth of Philippine foreign and domestic \ntrade, the latter was slow, for internal trade of the country was \nmostly in the hands of aliens. At the time of the inauguration \nof the Commonwealth, the Chinese controlled 50% of the \ndomestic trade, the Filipino 25%, the Japanese 20% and other \nnationalities 5%. The development of Philippine domestic trade \nunder the Americans was, therefore, not actually a boon to the \nFilipinos, who had to play second fiddle to the aliens. \nIn industry, the Philippines developed in the sense that fac¬ \ntories, such as textile and cigar and cigarette factories, mul¬ \ntiplied. Sawmills, coconut oil mills, cordage factories, fishing \nand fish-canning, alcohol distilleries, and sugar centrals were \nestablished beyond the wildest dreams of the Filipinos during \nthe Spanish period. Mining, one of the most important indus¬ \ntries, became the backbone of Philippine economy. In 1929, the \ngold mining industry produced P6,740,781 worth of gold; this \nfigure soared to P31,979,030 in 1935.

While it improved the stand¬ \nard of living, it was nevertheless artificial, for economic pros¬ \nperity was dependent on a relation that was basically unsound. \nOwing to the free trade relations, most of the Philippine ex¬ \nports went to American markets. Other foreign markets were \nneglected so that the closure of American ports to undutiable \nPhilippine exports resulted in economic dislocation. It was for \nthis reason that earlier Speaker Sergio Osmena and Resident \nCommissioner Manuel L. Quezon opposed free trade relations, \nfor it was their belief that Philippine dependence on the Amer¬ \nican markets would, in the long run, endanger the political in¬ \ndependence of the country. The unwisdom of such an arrange¬ \nment, that is, the free trade relations between the Philippines \nand the United States, was shown up when restrictions on the \nexportation of Philippine sugar, tobacco, hemp, and coconut \nwere provided in the Tydings-McDuffie Independence Act of \n1934. These restrictions worked havoc on Philippine economy, \nfor the surplus products that could no longer enter the Amer¬ \nican markets free of duty had a difficult time finding other foreign \nmarkets. The over-all effect of the Philippine-American free trade \nrelations was, therefore, the placing of Philippine economy at \nthe mercy of the Americans. \nTransportation and Communication.—Progress in health \nand welfare and in trade, commerce and industry was paralleled \nby similar progress in transportation and communication. Eco¬ \nnomic development would be meaningless if the means of trans¬ \nportation and communication were primitive, for commercial \nand industrial products- need to be transported efficiently to \nvarious places for marketing purposes. Thus the development \nof the country’s economy was accompanied by the development \nof means of communication and transportation.” This rapid de¬ \nvelopment is shown by a comparative study: at the end of the \nSpanish period, the Philippines had less than 1,^)0 miles of \nroad. By 1935, the mileage increased to 12,912.f2. Bridges \nand culverts numbered 2,600 in 1898; this number rose to 8,100 \nin 1935. The means of transportation vastly improved, for while \nthe ancient bull carts, carretelas, and calesas existed, the cars, \ntrucks, and railway cars speeded up the means of transportation. \nIn 1903, there were 195 kilometers of railway; in 1935, the \nnumber increased to 1,395 kilometers. This development in \nrailroad transportation was preceded by the government’s \nacquisition of the Manila-Dagupan Railway Company, which \nbecame the Manila Railroad Company.

Very little \ninterisland shipping existed during the Spanish period, for the \nSpanish colonial officials were more interested in hanging about \nManila than in developing the provinces economically. The in¬ \nterisland shipping during those days was limited to sailboats, \nbancas, cascos, and praus — certainly not efficient enough to \npromote interisland trade and commerce. With the coming of \nthe Americans, interisland shipping was encouraged. In 1902, \nthe American colonial government opened more than a hundred \nports to domestic shipping. To protect domestic coastwise ship¬ \nping the Philippine Legislature passed a law in 1923 providing \nthat only ships owned locally could engage in interisland shipping. \nProgress in communication was notable. Telephone lines \nwere introduced in Manila in 1905 and radio-telephone service \nin 1933. Towns and provincial capitals were linked together by \ntelephones, telegraph lines, and radio. Mail offices throughout \nthe country, numbering more than a thousand in 1935, handled \nordinary mail, telegrams, money orders, and air mail letters \nand packages. \nThe American role in the economic development of the \nPhilippines, particularly in the field of transportation and com¬ \nmunication, is not exactly altruistic. Doubtless, self-interest \nplayed a role that, though not obvious, was nevertheless per¬ \nvading. The improvement and building of roads, railways, and \nbridges meant importation of American tools, equipment, and \nmaterials. Good roads and bridges meant, too, importation \nof American trucks and cars. To make these vehicles run, im¬ \nportation of American oil and gasoline was imperative. Truck \nand automobile spare parts and tires were imported from the \nUnited States. Considering that American goods entered Philip¬ \npine ports duty-free, in accordance with the Payne-Aldrich Ta¬ \nriff Act of 1909, it is easy to conclude that the Philippines was \none of America’s greatest markets in the Orient. The American \nimperialists of 1898 were, therefore, justified in their clamor to \ntake the Philippines under the wing of the American Eagle. As \nthe history of the Philippines under the United States eloquently \ntestifies, American altruism was engrafted with profit motive."

Much of the \nugly connotations of the American intrusion in the Philippines \nwas whitewashed by extending to the Filipinos the democratic \nprinciple of equality — in rights and obligations as well as in \nopportunities. In view of what the Americans believed then as \ndangerous thoughts, the Filipinos in the early years of American \ntutelage were not allowed to enjoy the full measure of freedom. \nThe Sedition Law of 1901, passed by the Philippine Commission, \nconsidered it seditious of any Filipino to advocate independence. \nThe “Flag Law” of 1907 prohibited the display of the Filipino \nflag. Only when the American authorities became sure of the \npeace and order conditions did they scrap the two laws. \nExcept for these two laws which were operative during the \nearly years of the American regime, the Filipinos enjoyed the \nera of freedom — freedom of religious worship, freedom of the \npress, freedom to assemble peaceably for the redress of grievances, \nfreedom to change domicile, and freedom of speech. It is, how¬ \never, a mistake to suppose that the Americans taught the Filipinos \nthe meaning of freedom, that they brought from across the \nPacific tne heritage of democracy. The Filipinos knew the mean¬ \ning of freedom before the Americans came, for they enjoyed \nits blessings under the Revolutionary Government and the Re¬ \npublic. They had democracy, and practised it, when the Amer¬ \nicans arrived. They practised it in the Tejeros Convention, in \nthe election of delegates to the Malolos Congress, and in the \nframing of the Malolos Constitution. What the Americans did \nwas to broaden the democratic base, that is to say, they made \nthe principles of democracy apply to all — even to the poorest \nand illiterate common tao. \nSuch was the freedom enjoyed by the Filipinos that politi¬ \ncians and writers, even at the beginning of the American occu¬ \npation and despite the Sedition Law, attacked not only the \nAmerican administration, but also individual Americans who \ncommitted a misdemeanor. The pages of the nationalistic pe¬ \nriodical El Renacimiento and its Tagalog section, the Muling \nPagsilang, were fuU of vitriolic attacks on the Americans, cul¬ \nminating in the now famous “Aves de Rapiha” (Birds of Prey) \nLibel Case.

Kalaw, the editor \nof the paper, was sentenced to jail, but was pardoned by \nGovernor-General Harrison. \nThe freedom enjoyed by the writers found expression in \nthe drama. Nationalistic plays were staged to remind the peo¬ \nple of their freedom and independence. Aurelio Tolentino’s \nKahapon, Ngayon at Bukas (Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow), \nJuan Matapang Cruz’s Hindi Ak6 Patay (I Am Not Dead), Juan \nAbad’s Tanikal&ng Ginto (Gold Chains), and Severino Reyes’s \nWalang Sugat (Not Wounded), were proscribed by the authorities. \nTolentino, in particular, was arrested and jailed for advocating \nindependence in his play. \nAs the condition of peace and order improved, the repres¬ \nsion of civil liberties was removed.

The municipal elections tha: followed the im¬ \nplantation of American sovereignty gave the Filipinos the first taste \nof politics, American-brand. To be sure, there was at the begin¬ \nning no furor, no color to campaigns, for the Filipinos were as \nyet too politically naive to understand the intricacies of modem \npolitics. With the founding of political parties, however, they \nbegan u discern the American political pattern: issues were \noutlined, platforms were laboriously prepared, speeches were \ndelivered, and political chest funds accumulated. Up to approxi¬ \nmately 1916, however, Philippine national elections were honest \nand based on the merits of the issues involved. After the creation \nof a bicameral legislature in 1916, Philippine politics followed \nthe American groove. The electors, hitherto innocent, began \nto be corrupted by politicians. Expenses of candidates soared; \nthe electors, tasting for the first time the power of the ballot, \nbegan to think in terms of personality and personal welfare. \nThus many American political practices finally found a rich \nsoil in the Philippines."

The control of the law-making body and the \nFilipinization policy of Harrison led to a deep political con¬ \nsciousness. The suppressed nationalism of the first decade of \nAmerican rule was released and ultimately found expression in \nthe agitation for political independence. \nLanguage and Literature - Probably one of the most lasting \nAmerican influences in the Philippines is the development of \na Filipino literature in English and the adoption of American \nwords and phrases in the Philippine languages, particularly in \nTagalog. With English as the medium of instruction in all schools, \nmany talented Filipinos turned from their native languages to \nEnglish as the medium of creative expression. The pioneers \nduring the first two decades of American rule were Juan F. \nSalazar, Justo Juliano, Bernardo P. Garcia, Maximo M. Kalaw, \nTarcila Malabanan, Francisco M. Africa, and a few others, who \nwrote poems and essays that were a pale reflection of the national \nlife. Their command of English was, as was to be expected, rather \nloose. \nThe second generation of writers had better command of \nthe foreign language. Fernando M. Maramag, Carlos P. Romulo, \nMauro Mendez, Cristino Jamias, Vicente M. Hilario, Eliseo \nQuirino, and others were, with the exception of Maramag and \nMendez, essayists. Beginning with the 1930’s, the Filipino writers \nin English began to ramify: they wrote not only poems and \nessays, but also short stories and a few novels and dramas. The \nperiod from 1930 to the outbreak of the second World War \nwas dominated by the writers of the University of the Philip¬ \npines: Federico Mangahas, Salvador P. Lopez, Francisco B. Ica- \nsiano, Amando G. Dayrit, Maria Luna Lopez, Manuel Arguilla, \nTrinidad Tarrosa-Subido, Arturo B. Rotor, Francisco Arcellana, \nBienvenido N. Santos, Maria'Kalaw, and others. Among the \n“outsiders”, the most prominent were N. V. M. Gonzalez, A. E. \nLitiaco, Aurelio Alvero and Delfin Fresnosa. The drama and \nthe novel were the most neglected branches of literature, al¬ \nthough a few novels and plays were written. \nMore important as America’s lasting influence on Filipino \ncultural life was the adoption of American words and phrases \nin the national language.

A few English words, during the first \ndecade of the century, were adopted into Tagalog: bulakbol \n(blackball), “slacker”; basket; klase (through Spanish clase), \nclass. By the second and third decades, when American cultural \ninfluence had deeply penetrated the consciousness of the people, \nsuch words as paul (foul), parbol (foul ball), ining (inning), \nmindaun (men down in baseball), bistik (beefsteak), kendi \n(candy), ispiker (Speaker of the House), plorlider (Floor Lead¬ \ner), and scores of others, had become part of the Filipino vo¬ \ncabulary. Up to the present, there are about 600 or so English \nwords adopted in the national language. \nBy the third decade, the young Tagalog writers, deeply in¬ \nfluenced by English literature, began translating English phrases \ninto the national language. While some of the translations were \nfairly accurate and easily adaptable, yet many were simply awk¬ \nward or silly. Most of the English idioms, when translated into \nTagalog, became funny. These phrases, translated from English, \nare more or less adaptable: buhat sa sulok ng mga mata (out \nof the corner of one’s eyes), sa pagitan ng mga talath (between \nthe lines), sa likSd ng pangyayari (in spite of the fact), sa ibabaw \nng lahdt (above all), kalangitSng ipinagbawal (forbidden glory), \nand others. Overenthusiasm and ignorance of Tagalog idioms \ncompelled some writers to translate English phrases indiscrimi¬ \nnately. The result was unconscious humor. Samples: ihagis ang \nkaritbn sa tata (hitch the wagon to the stars), kumuha ng panukat- \nhukbd (to take military measures), mapanganib na lumilipad \n(dangerous fly), sumandal laban sa pader (to lean against the wall), \nmagbukas ng apSy (to open fire), etc. \nThe continued use of English as the medium of instruction \nmakes it a potent force in the cultural life of the people. It may \nin time be replaced by the national language, but its influence \non the latter has the character of permanence. \nNegative Results.—The American occupation has its seamy \nside. In the intimate contact of two peoples the good and the \nbad sides of the occupying power are inevitably adopted and \nadapted by the colony. As a people the Filipinos are apt pupils \nand need not be whipped into line to perform foreign “tricks.” \nThey are naturally imitative and can out-Spanish or out-Amer- \nican a Spaniards or an American. Thus many Filipinos take \npride in describing the Philippines not only as the only Chris¬ \ntian country in the Orient, — which means nothing — but also \nas the most Westernized country in the Orient."

American goods and \nservices were at first considered luxuries. After forty-five years \nof occupation, they became necessities. This conditioning of \nthe Filipino mind to the American standard of living has made \nthem economically dependent on the United States. The result \nis the neglect and consequent death of Filipino industries. No \none now hears of the Baliwag hats, or of the Malabon textile, \nor of many Filipino delicacies. They have been replaced by \nAmerican goods, which the Filipinos, in their sense of false pride, \ncall Stateside. Is your pair x>f shoes Stateside? Is your car im¬ \nported from the States or assembled here in the Philippines? \nSuch questions, though silly and pretentious, are common. If \nit is Stateside it is the best. If it is made in the Philippines it is \ninferior. \nThe mental attitude that despises one’s own and loves any¬ \nthing foreign is the natural result of American “altruism” bolstered \nby propaganda. While the Spaniards almost killed the Filipinos \nby maltreatment, the Americans, on the other hand, almost \nsmothered the Filipinos with “kindness.” The Spaniards softened \nthe Filipinos by inflicting physical and spiritual injuries on them; \nthe Americans softened the Filipinos by pampering their stomach. \nThe first became a negative factor in the development of Filipino \nnationalism; the second became a positive factor in the de-Fili- \npinization of the Filipinos. Thus, while enjoying the “blessings” \nof America, the Filipino suffered a partial loss of th$ir racial \nheritage: the ties that bind the family have been loosened; the \nlove of their language and culture has been replaced by the \nadoration of the American language and culture; and the tradi¬ \ntional communal unity has to a certain extent been superimposed \nupon by the “let-well-enough-aione” philosophy. \nThe softening of the Filipino spine, which resulted from too \nmuch American canned goods, in turn resulted in the persistence \nof the colonial mentality. Having developed an extreme liking \nfor things American without critical evaluation of their intrin¬ \nsic worth, the average Filipino considers it blasphemous to cri¬ \nticize the United States or any American. A Filipino who places \nhis country’s interest first and foremost is branded an anti- \nAmerican, for he does not consider the American incapable \nof erring.

The “movies” have been the \npurveyor of American materialism, for they show the advan¬ \ntages of having flashy cars, mink coats, large and well-appointed \nhouses, refrigerators, television and radio sets, and such other \nappurtenances as would make for “success.” Success is meas¬ \nured in terms of material possessions. He is successful who earns \na “fast buck”; he is successful who has made millions out of \nnothing; he is successful if, in spite of his illiteracy, he wins a \ncongressional or municipal seat. The people as a rule have lost \ntheir sense of values. Values to them are those that can be turned \ninto hard cash; if they are not or can’t, they are valueless. \nThere was a time when Filipinos looked up to the poets \nand thinkers. Women, too, adored them and swooned over them \nin the privacy of their chamber. With the intrusion of mate¬ \nrialism, they forgot their poets and thinkers — in fact, they \nridiculed them as “fildsofos” in the sense Padre Damaso used \nthe term. Poets are now described as “patay-gutom” — dead \nhungry, worthless creatures who live in dreams of what is not. \nToday, since American influence is a continuing process, the \nFilipino is as confused as ever. The tragedy is that this con¬ \nfusion is mistaken for genius to acquire material possessions. \nFilipinos excel as imitators. But their imitation is usually \nlimited to the seamy aspect of American life. The good Amer¬ \nican traits are seldom, if ever, acquired. Here again, the “mo¬ \nvies” have played an important role. Gangsterism, juvenile de¬ \nlinquency, promiscuous love affairs, betrayal, racketeering, graft \nand corruption — all these have been brought to the Philippines \nthrough Hollywood. Not that there was no gangsterism or graft \nand corruption before, but the American films have made them \npopular. Bandolerismo or brigandage there was during the \nSpanish regime, but American gangsterism, with its display of \nmachine guns and even brilliant strategy, is something new to \nthe Filipino experience.

Japanese naval bombers attacked Pearl Harbor in Hawaii \nin December 1941. The United States declared war against \nJapan and the war in the Pacific was formally on. As a conse¬ \nquence of this war, the Philippines was occupied by the Japanese. \nFor three years the Filipinos suffered the rigors of war. Civil \nliberties were suppressed by the enemy, the economy was geared \nto the demands of the Japanese war efforts, education was re¬ \nvamped to re-orient Filipino thinking along Japanese lines, and \npolitical life was limited to the Japanese-sponsored Republic. \nMeanwhile, thousands upon thousands were executed and im¬ \nprisoned, but the spirit of revolt continued to plague Japanese \nauthorities to the end of the occupation. \nBackground of Pearl Harbor .--One of the factors that led \nthe Americans to acquire the Philippines was the belief that \nthe colony would be of strategic importance to the United States. \nIt was then thought that with the Philippines under the United \nStates, no foreign Power would dare antagonize her.

In view of \nwhat Roosevelt considered a Japanese menace, he wrote William \nH.

Japan was \na fast rising power in the Pacific and the Philippine defenses \nwere rather inadequate to thwart any hostile attempt to invade \nthe country. The American military’s apprehensions were quiet¬ \ned when President Manuel L. Quezon, soon after the inaugura¬ \ntion of the Commonwealth, prevailed upon General Douglas \nMacArthur to become Field Marshal of the Philippine Army. \nMacArthur’s concept of defense was to build up a Filipino army \nsufficiently strong to repel a foreign invasion. Consequently, \nthe commonwealth Assembly’s first move was to pass Common¬ \nwealth Act No. 1, the National Defense Act, which provided for \na citizens’ army. With this army bolstered by bomber squad¬ \nrons based in the Philippines, it was thought that it would be \nfoolhardy for any foreign Power to invade the Philippines. \nMeanwhile, Japan was expanding in surrounding areas. \nManchuria was occupied in 1932. Five years later, China pro¬ \nper was invaded. In 1940, Japan occupied the northern part \nof French Indo-China and the following year the whole French \ncolony was occupied. The Japanese menace was now too obvious \nto be ignored. With Japanese troops concentrating in South¬ \neast Asia, Filipino and American leaders feared that the Philip¬ \npines might become the next target of the Japanese expansion \nprogram. On July 26, 1941, the Philippine reserve and reg¬ \nular forces were incorporated into the United States Army under \nthe command of General MacArthur. The combined forces \nwere called the United States Army Forces in the Far East \n(USAFFE). At the same time, the United States, Great Britain, \nand Holland imposed economic sanctions on Japan. The United \nStates, in particular, froze Japanese assets in the United States \nthereby preventing Japan from using these assets to her advantage. \nNevertheless, the United States exerted all efforts to come to \na peaceful understanding with Japan. In September 1941, Japan, \napparently to discuss American-Japanese problems in a peaceful \nmanner, sent Admiral K. Nomura to Washington. It was believed \nthat Nomura would propose peace to the American officials \nin order to avert war. It was while Nomura was presenting his \ngovernment’s peace proposals to Secretary of State Cordell Hull \nthat the Japanese bombers surprised Pearl Harbor in Hawaii \nand sank the cream of the American Navy. The bombing occurred \nin the early morning of December 7,1941, Hawaiian time."

The subjugation of the Philippines was a part of the \ngeneral plan of conquering the rich countries of Southeast Asia \nso that their natural resources could be used to bolster up Japan’s \nwar machine. \nWhile Pearl Harbor was being attacked, Japanese bombers \nand naval guns were shelling Wake Island.

Even before their planes could take off to attack tar¬ \ngets in the Philippines, three task forces were already on their \nway to the Philippines: two were to land in northern Luzon \nand one in Batan Island.

There was little opposition to these land¬ \nings, for there were not sufficient men to meet the enemy.

The people must be given \nthe necessary protection. Times will be hard. A big man is \nneeded for the job. You must stay.” Laurel, however, pointed \nout that the Japanese would make demands, some of them im¬ \npossible. “How far,” he asked, “can I go in cooperating with \nthem?” The question was legitimate, and Quezon had General \nMacArthur called to answer the question. “You can do anything,” \nsaid MacArthur, “but take the oath of allegiance to the Japanese. \nIf any one does that, I will shoot him when I return.” Then and \nthere Laurel was sworn in as Secretary of Justice to take the place \nof Abad Santos. Quezon turned to the high officials of the Com¬ \nmonwealth and gave them his last instructions: “Do the best you \ncan. Make what bargains you have to with those people [the \nJapanese]. Try to keep the Philippines together in one piece. \nTry to protect the people from Japan's brutality and avarice."

May on \nwhich took them to Corregidor. Here, on December 30, Quezon \ntook his oath of office as President of the Commonwealth, \nmarking the end of his first term and the beginning of his second \nterm. \nThe Fall of Bataan and Corregidor.-MacArthur’s retreat \nto Bataan was a brilliant maneuver, for in the process he out¬ \nwitted General Masaharu Homma, the Japanese commander-in¬ \nchief, who failed in his attempt to encircle the USAFFE as he \nhad contemplated. Maneuvering in a limited territory, Mac- \nArthur succeeded in keeping his army intact and well coordin¬ \nated. Several times, the Japanese launched their offensives \nagainst Bataan only to be repulsed with heavy losses. It was \nthe strategy of the Japanese Imperial Command to .subjugate \nthe Philippines within a short period of time in order to pro¬ \nceed immediately to the conquest of other parts of Asia. The \nheroic defense of the Filipino-American troops on Bataan irri¬ \ntated the Japanese. Again and again, Japanese land and sea \nforces, aided by bombers, returned to the attack, but the Ba¬ \ntaan lines held out heroically. Japanese leaflets asking the Fili¬ \npino soldiers to surrender and to desert their American com- \nrades-in-arms were dropped on Bataan to demoralize the USAFFE, \nbut the courageous Filipino soldiers ignored the Japanese \npropaganda. \nAs months dragged on, aid from the United States seemed \nimpossible. The Japanese navy commanded the sea lanes of the \nPacific. Moreover, the United States and Great Britain had already \nagreed on the “Europe-First Policy.” The effect on the Bataan \ndefenders was partial demoralization, for without arms, \nammunition, and food the USAFFE was bound to disintegrate \nunder the pressure of continued enemy attacks. By mid-March \n1942, rations became scarce. Lack of food led to malnutrition. \nDiarrhea, malaria, and avitaminosis or lack of Vitamins in the \nbody led to a casualty bigger than that inflicted by enemy bullets. \nMedicine was scarce, too, and the men, suffering from the rigors \nof war, began to lose hope.

On April 9, General Edward P. \nKing, commander of the forces on Bataan, surrendered. Some \n78,000 of General King’s forces were included in the surrender \nnegotiations. Around 2,000 escaped to Corregidor and to the \nsurrounding provinces. Wainwright, as USAFFE commander- \nin-chief, was in Corregidor.' King’s surrender on Bataan, there¬ \nfore, was an individual surrender, and not the surrender of the \nentire USAFFE force. Thus ended the Battle of Bataan which \nresounded throughout the world. \nThe surrendered Filipino-American troops were forced at \ngunpoint to march from Bataan to San Fernando, Pampanga, \nunder the hot tropical sun. Those who could not march because \nof physical weakness were shot down or bayoneted. So inhuman \nwas the forced march that the event has been called the “Death \nMarch”. In Capas, the prisoners were huddled together like \nanimals, hungry and sick. \nMeanwhile, the Japanese stepped up their offensive against \nCorregidor. From Bataan, now under the Japanese, from the \nsea, and from Cavite, the island fortress was subjected to in¬ \ntense fire. There was no rest for the defenders; the enemy bomb¬ \nings were continuous, day and night. In Manila, in the stillness \nof the night, the people could hear the successive bombings \nand artillery fire directed against Corregidor. Against the clear \nsky the people of the city could see orange flashes that heralded \nthe booms of the enemy artillery pounding relentlessly at the \nhistoric island. In the morning of May 6, General Wainwright \naddressed a message to General Homma, through the 4tVoice \nof Freedom”, offering to surrender. In the afternoon, he met \nGeneral Homma at the conference table. The barrel-chested \nHomma demanded the surrender of the entire USAFFE forces \nin the Philippines. Wainwright hedged, his intention being to \nsurrender only the men directly under him. But Homma insisted \non the surrender of all, and stood up to leave. Wainwright had \nno other alternative than to give in to the enemy’s demand. \nThe fall of the Philippines, at least officially, was now complete."

By February, the Japanese \nwere ready to institute sweeping reforms in the administration \nof the government. On January 23, Homma issued an order \nto Jorge B. Vargas making him the Chairman of the Executive \nCommission. The national government was re-named the Cen¬ \ntral Administrative Organization, composed of six executive \ndepartments: Interior; Finance; Justice; Agriculture and Com¬ \nmerce; Education, Health and Public Welfare; and Public Works \nand Communications. Each of the departments was headed by \na Commissioner, whose duty was to “execute an administration \nwithin his jurisdiction under the control of the ‘Chairman of the \nExecutive Commission’.” The limitations upon the powers and \nprerogatives of the Commissioners were assured for the Japan¬ \nese when the same order provided that “Each department shall \nhave a Japanese adviser and Japanese assistant advisers.” It \nis pretty clear that the Japanese “advisers” were nothing more \nthan spies of the Japanese military authorities. To make sure \nthat apparently harmless persons were to take the reins of gov¬ \nernment, the order further provided that Vargas’ r(‘commendation \nfor the Commissionership of any department or for any subor¬ \ndinate position was to be approved by the Japanese Commander- \nin-Chief. The organization of each department and the courts \nof justice was to remain substantially the same as during the \nCommonwealth, “provided that their outlines be approved by \nthe Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Japanese Forces.” On \nthe provincial and municipal level, the order provided for the \nstatus quo. To aid the Central Administrative Organization \nin administering the occupied territory, the Council of State \nwas created on January 29 as an advisory body.

The only worthy courses were \nthose they believed could help in the prosecution of Japan’s \nconcept of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. \nIn accordance with Japanese mandates, the Department of \nEducation, Health and Public Welfare authorized, on March 31, \n1942, the re-opening of public elementary schools beginning in \nJune 1942. There was not much enthusiasm in returning to \nschools, first, because the Filipinos as a whole were suspicious \nof Japanese intention, and second, because the children found \nmore enjoyment and money in selling anything or in helping \ntheir parents tide over the difficult times. This lack of enthu¬ \nsiasm to receive instruction under the Japanese regime was reflect¬ \ned in the comparative smallness of the enrollment: the total \nenrolled in elementary grades as of March 1943 was 267,977. \nWhen the Japanese-sponsored Republic was proclaimed on \nOctober 14, 1943, the educational set-up did not change much. \nHowever, President Jose P. Laurel added the fundamental prin¬ \nciple of militant nationalism. It was Laurel’s belief that the \nFilipinos could stave off spiritual debacle only by resorting to \nnationalism as a way of life. Consequently, he encouraged the \npropagation of Tagalog as the national language by using it as \nthe official language. Educational reforms were instituted by \nrequiring teachers to obtain licenses after undergoing a rigid \nexamination. The teaching of Tagalog, Philippine History, and \ncharacter education was reserved for Filipinos. Teachers’ li¬ \ncenses were also required of all heads of schools, colleges, and \nuniversities. Laurel also required that majority of the govern¬ \ning board of any school, college or university be Filipino citi¬ \nzens. All these were directed at the implementation of the na¬ \ntionalist credo. For the first time in Philippine history, the \naliens were barred from teaching the Filipinos their own his¬ \ntory, a history that had been hitherto interpreted according to \nalien points-of-view. \nThe Republic.—The Japanese authorities realized that it \nwas difficult, if not impossible, to channel Filipino sympathy \ntoward them and consequently did everything in their power, \nfrom threats to caress, to dissipate the Filipinos’ hostility.

He said: \n“Substantial progress is being made in the degree of coopera¬ \ntion rendered to the Japanese Empire by the people of the Phil¬ \nippines as well as in the restoration of peace and security. Under \nthese circumstances and on condition that further tangible \nevidence of cooperation is actively demonstrated, it is contem¬ \nplated to put into effect the statement made previously on the \nquestion of Philippine independence in the shortest time \npossible.” \nThe Filipino leaders were, however, not fooled by these \nempty promises. Nevertheless, they went into the motion of \nrejoicing over the announcement of Philippine “independence.” \nOn January 30, 1943, Jorge B. Vargas pledged support of the \nFilipinos in the attainment of independence, and on February \n8, a rigged demonstration of gratitude to Japan for the promise \nof early independence was held in Manila. Not to be outdone \nin the staging of the grand comedy, the Council of State, with \ntongue in cheek, issued a manifesto on February 26, exhorting \nthe people to exert all efforts towards the fulfillment of inde¬ \npendence.

Amidst \nthe simulated applause and hurrahs of the Filipino audience \nwho had no choice in the matter, the Declaration of Independence \nwas read, the Republic inaugurated, and President Laurel inducted \ninto office, October 14,1943. \nThinking of a common effort to save the country from the \ntragedy that had befallen it, Laurel concluded his inaugural ad¬ \ndress with these words: \n* * * I am sure our people will rise as one to meet the challenge \n* * * We shall encounter difficulties greater than any we have ever \nfaced in our national history.

Not having anything worth¬ \nwhile to do, some policemen joined the cry and the tumult and \nwent home with some loot. The ruthless looting was not con¬ \nfined in Manila; the same lawlessness and barbarism were ex¬ \nhibited in the suburbs. Within a few days, the looted goods \nwere seen being peddled around in the streets and markets. \nThe Japanese occupation was infamous not only because of \nthe ferocity of the military conquerors, but also because the \nFilipinos as a whole had lost their social and moral balance. In \nCapas, where the Filipino soldiers were reconcentrated, thousands \namong the courageous Bataan defenders died not only because \nof malnutrition and the outbreak of diseases, but also because \n.some of the Filipino army physicians consciencelessly denied \nthe suffering soldiers the medicine necessary to relieve them of \ntheir pain. When the Japanese authorities allowed the relatives \nand friends of the surrendered soldiers to send medicine and \nfood, the same army physicians conveniently set aside the Hi- \npocratic oath and engaged in the sale of food and medicine, \nparticularly sulfathiazole, sulfanilamide, and quinine, which \nwere, in the first place, not for them but for the ailing soldiers. \nThe “Tragedy of Capas” consisted in the betrayal of the sick \nsoldiers by their fortunate comrades-in-arms. Relatives and \nfriends of sick soldiers, who had thoughtfully sent them food \nand medicine, believed they had done a good deed and hoped \nthat, somehow, their unfortunate loved ones would be released \nin good physical condition. They were mistaken. The mer¬ \nchant-physicians, at least those involved in the racket, kept the \nmedicine and, the irony of it all, sold it at astronomical prices, \nin genuine Philippine pesos, to the very ones to whom the medicine \nwas sent.

The only consolation in receiving such pieces of paper \nw£ts that they could be used as cigarette paper. Many haciendas \nremained idle for a time. Then the Japanese planters came and \nplanted them to cotton, a commodity needed by the Japanese \nwar lords. Rice production sank to a new low, and the limited \nquantities produced were taken by the Japanelk military to feed \ntheir men. The natural upshot was the prohibitive price of rice. \nThe people of Manila, not having an inch of agricultural land \nto their credit, suffered most. The lowly farmers, hitherto \nlooked down upon by the bourgeoisie and the absentee. land¬ \nlords, rose in importance. It was a common experience to see \nthe best furniture of the city being carted to the rural areas: \nthe hitherto well-heeled capitalists and employees of Manila and \nother cities had to part with their pieces of furniture in exchange \nfor a sack of rice. For a time, then, the yokels enjoyed the finer \nthings of life. The shy barrio damsel now could be seen looking \nat herself in a large mirror of a narra aparador, imagining herself \nin the place of the young society debutante who had probably \nspent much time admiring herself before that very same mirror. \nThe lowly takba and haul, repositories of yellowed dresses, were \nreplaced by the best aparador. The old-fashioned dresses and \nshirts, too, were superseded by polo shirts and “modern” dresses \nbought from the secondhand dealers on Bambang and Anak ng \nBayan Streets. In some cases, these dresses, polo shirts, and \ntrousers were stolen from the interred dead at La Loma and the \nNorth Cemeteries. Farmers who had lost a tooth or two now \ncould afford to have gold teeth, the gold, in most cases, having \nbeen extracted by ghouls from the teeth of the dead in the ceme¬ \nteries. In the streets, especially on Azcarraga near the Dulong \nBayan Market, men and women, mostly women, called out aloud: \n“Baka may gintong ngipin kayo riyan! Baka may gintong ngipin \nkayo!” — Do you have gold teeth with you? Do you have gold \nteeth? Meaning that they would buy your gold teeth. This \ndemand for gold led the conscienceless and the unscrupulous \nto dig the graves or destroy the tombs of the innocent dead in \nthe cemeteries for gold or for polo shirts and trousers. The \ndesecration of the graves, punishable with death in pre-Spanish \ntimes, became common resulting, naturally, in the release of the \nindescribable odor of decayed and decaying bodies. \nBecause there was practically no production, most of the \npeople engaged in the buy-and-sell business.

Anything \ncould be sold and purchased at prices which returned good pro¬ \nfits. The Japanese unwittingly encouraged this kind of business \nby manufacturing what the Filipinos called “Mickey Mouse” \nmoney. The result was inflation. One had to carry a bayong or \nsmall sack full of “Mickey Mouse” money to buy a few gantas \nof rice. Everything was sold at an astronomical price. A box \nof ordinary match cost, in 1944, more than a hundred “Mickey \nMouse” pesos. The Japanese, however, tried to cushion the \nimpact of their occupation on the economy of the country by \ndistributing goods to the people at prices determined by the \nmilitary authorities. But the Filipinos, who had learned much \nfrom the Chinese, became masters in the art of going around \nthe law. A box of match from a distributing center cost no \nmore than ten “Mickey Mouse” centavos. Outside, the recipients \nof the rations sold the innocent box for, at the beginning of \nthe occupation, thirty centavos. Cigarettes, too, became rare. \nAmerican cigarettes commanded the highest prices. In the \ncircumstances, those who could not afford to buy at such prices \nmanufactured their own cigarettes out of the dried papaya leaves. \nCigarette paper disappeared and the people used the newspapers \nand books for their purpose. So common was this practice that \nwags boasted, “I am smoking the Encyclopedia Britannica!” \nThe more imaginative among the Filipinos manufactured two \nkinds of cigarettes: the doctored cigarettes, which were not so \nbad, and the “American” cigarettes such as Camel, Chesterfield \nand Lucky Strike. Malabon, Rizal, was the manufacturing center \nof these “American” cigarettes. The deception was so complete \nthat no one could distinguish, except the manufacturers them¬ \nselves, between a genuine Chesterfield and a fake one. Even the \ntaste was so much alike that the Malabon impostors got away \nwith their trade for quite a time. \nAs to coffee and tea, the Filipinos had them, too. Coffee \ncould be had at second hand, that is, the used grains of coffee \nwere dried in the sun and sold to those who were willing to be \nsuckers. Ersatz or substitute coffee or tea was common. Mango \nleaves, when boiled, became the substitute for tea. The best \nsubstitute for coffee were toasted rice and com.

The Economic Planning Board gave \nmuch of its time to the problem of production and procurement \nof rice and other prime necessities. As a result, the Bigasang \nBayan (popularly known as BIBA) was organized to control \nthe procurement and distribution of rice and other cereals. Con¬ \nsumers’ Cooperatives were created in Manila to allow private \ninitiative to help BIBA in its functions.

The men of the cities and plains \nhad five mortal enemies: the Japanese military, diseases, the \nguerrillas, hunger, and the Japanese-paid Filipino spies. Escape \nin the circumstances was difficult, for the war hysteria made \nmen unreasonable. Those who escaped unscathed could only be \nthankful and pray, after the liberation, that the Almighty had \nbeen merciful to them. \nWhen the Japanese succeeded in occupying the whole coun¬ \ntry, the enemy Kempeitai (Military Police) began a career of \nwanton disregard of human lives. Houses with unregistered \nradios were raided and their occupants maimed and then thrown \ninto the dungeons of Fort Santiago, where inhuman punish¬ \nments were meted out to them as daily exercise. Punishments \nconsisted of the “water cure”, the same technique that the early \nAmericans introduced in the Philippines. Hanging a suspected \nguerrilla by the hand, then hitting him with a four-by-four piece \nof wood, was executed with consummate skill. Oftentimes, the \nJapanese soldiers made a punching bag of a prisoner’s body. \nWorst of all, the tormentors pressed red-hot iron or electric \nwire into the flesh of the helpless prisoner’s body. Unrecorded \nnumber of men and women died in Fort Santiago. A few of \nthem, unable to withstand the inhuman tortures they had been \nundergoing daily, were forced to cry out the names of the \nguerrillas. In this way, some resistance men and women were \ncaptured and executed by having their heads cut off with the \nrazor-blade samurai sword. \nIn the early days of the occupation, the Japanese and the \nrecruits under their rule raped many women. Not a few brothers \nor husbands died fighting the beastly soldiers in defense of their \nsisters or wives. Those who could not fight back took to the \nmountains and joined the guerrillas. Retribution was terrible, \nfor the Filipino is vindictive. He places personal honor above \nlife itself and will not stop until his thirst for vengeance has been \nsatisfied. And so, some of the Japanese soldiers caught in the \nambush, who were probably innocent of the crimes committed \nby their beastly comrades-in-arms, paid dearly.

The most feared \nJapanese word was kura, which meant two things to the Fili¬ \npinos depending upon the movement of the Japanese hand: a \n“Kura!” with an inward wave of the hand meant “Come here!”, \nwhich signified disaster; a “Kura!”' with an outward wave of \nthe hand meant “Dismiss!” or “Scram!” Slapping was a common \nsight. A Filipino was slapped for not bringing his residence \ncertificate with him. He was slapped for not bowing properly \nto the sentry. He was slapped for not being understood by a \nJapanese sentry. He was slapped for having a face the Japanese \ndid not like. This slapping propensity of the Japanese may be \ncommon to them and may not mean much to them, but to the \nFilipino it is an insult. To him slapping is a sign of condescension. \nHe prefers to be boxed. To slap him is to say that he is inferior \nas a man; only women, in his estimation, are slapped. And so \nthe Japanese military, who did not make any attempt to study \nFilipino psychology, failed to win the confidence and sympathy \nof the Filipinos. It is true, as the Japanese themselves suspected, \nthat almost all Filipinos were guerrillas. \nSide by side with the danger of Japanese presence was the \nspy. One may escape the brutality of the enemy, but one was \nconfronted with the presence of spies one did not know. In his \nenthusiasm over the results of a naval battle, for instance, a \nFilipino might whisper to another the defeat of the Japanese \nnavy. Or he might whisper, quite innocently, “The Kano are \ncoming!” in the belief that all Filipinos were pro-Americans. \nThis bad logic sometimes resulted in the execution of the naive \nwho gloated prematurely over the victory of the American navy. \nSo a prudent Filipino talked only to his close friends about the \nwar and about the return of MacArthur. \nThe guerrillas, on the other hand, were quick to liquidate \nFilipinos whom they suspected of collaboration. To the resist¬ \nance men, it was enough that one succumbed, at the point of the \nbayonet, to enemy promises to be considered pro-Japanese. \nMany guerrillas were unreasonable and unreasoning and saw \nonly their points, not of others. Thus, a guerrilla outfit, labor-"

Other outfits ordered \nthe liquidation of men they did not like in the name of free¬ \ndom and democracy. The Filipinos in the cities and plains, \ntherefore, feared the guerrillas as much as they feared the Kem- \npeitai. And yet, without those who stayed in the cities and towns \nthe guerrillas would have had a bad time making both ends meet, \nfor even those who engaged in the buy-and-sell business con¬ \ntributed heavily, directly or indirectly, to the coffers of the \nguerrilla outfits. \nOwing to economic dislocation and the scarcity of food, \nthousands died of malaria, malnutrition, tuberculosis, and other \ndiseases. Medicine, too, was scarce. Sulfathiazole, the wonder \ndrug of the period, commanded an impossible price. In the \nstreets could be seen men, women, and children suffering from \neither extreme hunger or tropical ulcer with hundred of flies \nfeasting on the large fresh wounds. Men, women and children, \ntheir faces deathly white and their lips parched, scrounged the \ngarbage cans in the public markets and in the streets to salvage \nanything that could take the place of food. Many died on the \nsidewalks, their identity unknown. Hundreds were executed \nby the Japanese for stealing food or anything that could be \nsold in the buy-and-sell mart. To the hungry and the desperate \nonly courage remained: it took a great deal of physical courage \nto steal from the Japanese knowing, as they did, that death was \nthe recompense for such an attempt. Many took the chances, \nand some escaped the enemy; others were less fortunate and \ndied heroically in the desire to make their families less hungry \nand destitute. \nSuch a condition naturally produced social derelicts. Crimes \nagainst persons and property multiplied. Burglary and holdups \nwere common occurrences. The law-enforcement agencies were \nhelpless not only because the agents of the law had no weapons \nwith which to frighten burglars and other criminals into sub¬ \nmission, but also because they understood the temper of the \nperiod. They themselves were hungry and were they not agents \nof the law they would probably have turned to the highway \nto rob and, in the emergency, to kill in order to survive in a \nhighly competitive and hostile surrounding. \nAll was not bleak, however.

There were, \ntoo, stage presentations consisting mainly of slapstick comedies \nin which some courageous actors rediculed the Japanese soldiers. \nOne, who played the role of a Japanese sentry, decorated his \ntwo arms with genuine wrist watches — an acidic commentary \non the Japanese military who forcibly confiscated wrist watches \nand wore them on both arms. That courageous actor did not \nstay long on the stage: he was promptly arrested and tortured \nin Fort Santiago. But he gave the people at least a few minutes \nof genuine laughter. \nFrom the social and economic points of view, the Japanese \noccupation resulted, first, in the rise of a new bourgeoisie whose \nantecedents were but dimly outlined. They were the men who, \nthough not exactly well bred, had raw courage and imagination \nin business and were ruthless enough to deal with both the Japan¬ \nese and the Filipinos. Second, the rise of this new bourgeoisie \nled to the breakdown of the old social-elite class. Heretofore, \nthe social Elites came from the old, respectable, and wealthy \nland-owning families. With the enemy occupation, these elites \nno longer held the monopoly of the social circle; it was broken \nby the rushing in of the new rich. The result was the demo¬ \ncratization of the old, stiff upper-class society. Lastly, the \npyramid of Filipino society widened at the base, for more people \ndescended to the depths and became the social problems of the \npost-war era. No doubt the grim experience of the war years, \nwherein society became a wilderness ruled by the law of the \njungle, made most men ruthless and materialistic. They would \nnot want to be the victims once more of conditions and situations \nthat would make them helpless pawns in the social struggle. \nHence the intensification of graft and corruption which began \nwith the distribution of relief goods during the first post-war \nyear and which ramified into the diverse sources of “easy” money, \nsuch as the disposition of the equipment and materials left in \nthe Philippines after the war by the American armed forces. \nCultural Aspects.—-Aside from slapstick comedies present¬ \ned before pleasure-hungry populace, there were the movie theaters \nwhich presented pre-war American films. These films, however, \nwere previously censored by the authorities to make sure that \nthey were of the harmless type. In between presentations of \nAmerican films were Japanese films glorifying the Japanese \nwar machine and way of life — certainly the kind of propaganda \nmaterials that the Filipino audience got tired of because of their \nbanality."

Even before the Japanese entry into Ma¬ \nnila, guerrilla units had already been formed in anticipation of \nwhat was then believed as the short stay of enemy in the Phil¬ \nippines. When Bataan and Corregidor fell, quite a number of \nFilipino and American officers and soldiers succeeded in escaping \nto the mountains and there directed the underground movement. \nSabotage on large and small scale, aimed at the paralyzing the \nJapanese war efforts, was conducted. Reports of enemy move¬ \nments, losses, strength, and disposition of troops were sent to \nMacArthur’s headquarters in Australia. These reports helped \nMacArthur immensely in planning his return to the Philippines. \nHe knew exactly where to land and what to expect from the \nenemy. The long wait ended when the American forces hit the \nbeach of Leyte in October 1944. Other landings were made in \nMindoro, Batangas, and Lingayen in subsequent months.

The Japanese knew \nthat the Filipinos loved the Americans and the announcement \nthat the Filipinos would be allowed to developed their culture and \nthat the Philippines was for the Filipinos was a part of the Japan¬ \nese gamble to alienate the former’s affection from the Americans. \nBut the ways of the Japanese military neutralized their propa¬ \nganda line of making the Philippines an important part of the \nGreater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This explains why a \ngreat majority of the Filipinos turned guerrillas and potential \nguerrillas. \nWith the retreat of the USAFFE to Bataan, the officers and \nsoldiers who were isolated by the rapid advance of the enemy \norganized guerrilla units. In the north, Walter M. Cushing formed \na guerrilla outfit consisting of the 121st Infantry; Colonel \nGuillermo Nakar commanded the 14th Infantry; and Colonel \nParker Calvert the 43rd Infantry. By July 1942, the North Luzon \nguerrilla units were tightly knit and by September active resistance \nmovement commenced. Cushing’s underground activities came \nto an end when, on September 19, 1942, while in Jones, Isabela, \nwith three Filipino soldiers on a mission to contact a large guerrilla \noutfit, he and his men were fired upon by Japanese soldiers. \nCushing and two of his men died on the spot. Cushing and his \nband had killed 500 enemy soldiers along the coast of Ilocos \nbefore his death. \nThe death of Cushing did not dampen the enthusiasm of \nthe northern Luzon guerrillas. Governor Roque Ablan of Ilocos \nNorte refused to surrender to the enemy and withdrew to the \nmountains where he organized his own guerrilla unit.

In \nSouthern Luzon, the PQOG (President Quezon’s Own Guerrillas) \noperated in Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, and Quezon, while in the \nBicol region former Assemblyman and Governor, Wenceslao Q. \nVinzons, headed the guerrilla outfit. \nIn the Visayas, the most prominent guerrilla leaders were \nColonel Ruperto Kangleon, who operated in Samar and Leyte; \nColonel Macario Peralta, of Tarlac, led the Panay guerrillas, \nwith Governor Tomas Confesor as the civilian leader. In Min¬ \ndanao, the guerrillas were headed by Tomas Cabili, Wendell \nFertig, and Salipada Pendatun.

There was only one thought uppermost \nin their minds, and it was to help drive away the invaders from \nPhilippine soil. \nGuerrilla Newspapers.*—Truthful news report about the \nwar was impossible under the enemy, for the press and the radio \nwere controlled. It was natural that the Japanese should resort \nto propaganda lies to achieve their purpose of demoralizing the \nFilipinos and of making them believe in the invincibility of \nJapan. People who read the Tribune and other Japanese-con¬ \ntrolled magazines read between the lines, but such reading was \nnot sufficient to slake their thirst for real news. Two ways \nwere open to the Filipinos to get real news: first, by tuning \nin their radios to Radio San Francisco at the risk of being \ncaught in the act and then beheaded by the enemy; and second, \nby reading, also at the risk of being beheaded, the guerrilla \n“newspapers.” \nThe only limited contact the Filipinos had with the outside \nworld was with Radio San Francisco. Beamed to the Philip¬ \npines, Radio San Francisco broadcast news about the war in \nEurope and in Asia and events of general interest, particularly \nto Filipinos. Though the Japanese authorities ordered the re¬ \nconditioning and registration of all radios, some Filipinos \ncourageously violated the Japanese law in order to get the real \nnews from the other side of the Pacific. The Japanese tech¬ \nnicians tried to disturb the reception of the news by clogging \nthe air lanes, but somehow the news came through with suf¬ \nficient clarity to be written down and disseminated to many \nwho were prepared to risk their lives. Typewritten or mimeo¬ \ngraphed copies of these news items were made and distributed \nsecretly to the people. Many of these news items were copied \nand reprinted by the guerrilla “newspapers.” \nThe need for keeping up the faith in the democratic tra¬ \ndition and for counteracting Japanese propaganda led some \nguerrilla outfits to put out their “newspapers.” These were not \nprinted but mimeographed, sometimes, typewritten. Colonel \nGuillermo Nakar, operating in the Sierra Madre near Nueva \nVizcaya, put out the mimeographed newspaper Matang Law in \n(Hawk’s Eye).

Some of its writers were \ncaught by the Japanese circulating the little news magazine \nand were executed, but Ty and a few of his companions escaped \nthe enemy dragnet. \nEarlier in 1943, a typewritten newspaper, The Flash, came \nout in Tagalog, Spanish, and English. Pedro de la Liana, a \nwriter who became prominent in the 1920’s, edited the paper. \nIt had a sprinkling of news about the war and articles de¬ \nnouncing the Japanese Military Administration.

In Pampanga and else¬ \nwhere in Central Luzon, the powerful guerrilla organization, \nthe HUKBALAHAP, put out the newspaper Ing Masala (The \nLight). Edited in Arayat, it circulated among the peasants as \nearly as October 1942. Ing Masala was so effective that the \npeasants of Pampanga and Tarlac forged a unity that made the \norganization the most powerful in Central Luzon.

They visited several islands in the Visayas, which \nwere still free, and boosted the morale of the people.

Quezon wanted to continue as \nPresident even beyond the term provided for by the Constitu¬ \ntion, but some of the men around him felt that Osmena should \nsucceed him in accordance with the highest law of the land. \nOsmena, however, thought that there must be unity in the ranks \nand knowing that Quezon wanted to continue as President he \nprepared a resolution to the.

Thus Quezon continued to remain at \nthe top of the Commonwealth Government.

Slowly and painfully, the \nAmerican naval and marine forces inched their way north from \nthe vicinity of Australia.

Meanwhile, a huge naval \nbattle was shaping up in the Philippine Sea off the Pacific coast. \nIn mid-June, the Japanese fleet, composed of carriers, battle¬ \nships, cruisers, and destroyers, rushed toward the Marianas to \nrelieve the Japanese garrisons there. Admiral Raymond Spruance, \ncommanding the American Fifth Fleet, waited for the enemy \nwest of the Marianas. At the same time, he sent carrier-based \nairplanes to attack Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima to neutralize the \nJapanese bases in the islands. On June 19, the Battle of the \nPhilippine Sea began.

The Battle of the Philippine Sea prevented \nthe Japanese from reinforcing the Marianas, on the one hand, and \nled to the subsequent capture of the islands by the Americans, \non the other. \nIn Manila, the Japanese put out a small or “pony” edition \nof the Tribune describing in broad outlines the alleged destruc¬ \ntion of the American fleet.

American territorial losses \nduring the early phase of the war were now being recovered, \nand the way to the Philippines was being paved.

In the Southwest Pacific, \nMacArthur’s forces occupied Morotai Island, and struck at \nnorthern Celebes, Halmahera, Ceram, and Vogelkop. By the \nmiddle of 1944, the American forces were in a position to tighten \nthe noose around Japan’s neck. On September 21, while Manila \nwas listening to the Japanese-controlled Radio Station PIAM, \nthe American carrier based planes swooped down upon the city \nundetected. The air attack coincided with the Japanese target \npractice, so that both the Japanese and the Filipinos were unaware \nof the presence of American planes above.

This carrier strike led Admiral Halsey to the \nconclusion that the invasion of the Philippines must begin in \nLeyte and not in Mindanao, as originally contemplated by Mac- \nArthur. The strikes showed that the Japanese air resistance was \nweak in the Visayas. Moreover, Halsey suggested the acceleration \nof the date of invasion to prevent the enemy from strengthening \nhis defenses in the weak areas. Consequently, with the approval \nof President Roosevelt, the date for the invasion of Leyte was \nset for October 20. The way was now paved for the “return of \nthe beloved.” \nThe Leyte Landings.—The landings in the Philippines were \nto be carried out by the forces under General MacArthur. Such \na task meant the convergence of troop transports, supply ships, \nfire support ships, escort carriers, mine craft, landing craft, and \ncargo ships. The American forces, known as the Central Philippine \nAttack Force, were divided into the Northern Attack Force and \nthe Southern Attack Force. All in all, the American attack \nforce consisted of 650 ships and four army divisions. \nThe softening of the enemy positions on Leyte was carried \nout by carrier strikes which lasted from October 9 to 20. At \nthe same time, similar raids were conducted on Pescadores, For¬ \nmosa, and northern Luzon in order to paralyze Japanese ac¬ \ntivities and defenses. Central Luzon took a share of the carrier \nattack on October 18 and 19, while units of the American navy \nscoured the seas in the Visayas to prevent the Japanese navy \nfrom interfering with operations in Leyte. \nOn October 11, the long line of American attack force left \nNew Guinea. Target: Leyte. Minesweepers preceded the main \nattack force. On October 20, the Leyte beaches were severely \nbombarded from the air and from the sea. The small islands \nguarding the entrances to Leyte were secured on the same day. \nChannels and landing beaches were immediately cleared of mines. \nWith file enemy neutralized by heavy bombings and naval guns, \ntwo army crops landed in the morning of October 20. Beach¬ \nheads were established and soon the troops fanned out in several \ndirections to drive out the enemy. The Americans had returned. \nThe Battle for Leyte Gulf.—The Leyte landings brought \nhome to the Japanese naval and military authorities the urgent \nmenace those landings presented to them.

It \nwas thought to counterattack by air and naval ships in order to \ndestroy the American fleet guarding and protecting the Leyte \nbeachheads. For this purpose three naval forces were to con¬ \nverge on Leyte Gulf: the Northern Force, under Admiral Ji- \nsaburo Ozawa, was to sail from Japan, down the eastern coast \nof Luzon, and on to Leyte Gulf; the Central Force, under Admi¬ \nral Takeo Kurita, was to steam through San Bernardino Strait \nand on to Leyte Gulf; and the Southern Force, divided into two \ngroups, one under Vice Admiral Shoji Nishimura and the other \nunder Admiral Kiyohide Shima, was to reach Leyte Gulf through \nthe Surigao Strait. \nThe Battle for Leyte Gulf, the greatest naval battle in his¬ \ntory, was fought simultaneously in three different places from \nOctober 24 to 26. In its magnitude and significance, the Battle \nfor Leyte Gulf exceeded all previous naval combat, including \nthe Battle of Jutland during World War I. \nThe Battle of Surigao Strait.—The Japanese Southern \nForce, coming from Singapore, entered the narrow Surigao Strait \nin the darkest hours of October 25. The American task force, \nheaded by Rear Admiral J. B. Oldendorf, waited for the enemy* \nin complete silence. The Japanese commander, not suspecting \nthat his approach had been discovered, continued steaming down \n' the strait with self-confidence. At the precise moment when \nthe enemy ships were within range of the American heavy guns, \nOldendorf gave the signal to attack. First the PT boats, then \nthe cruisers, the destroyers, and the battleships, attacked with \nsuch fury that Admiral Nishimura did not know what hit him. \nHe ordered star shells fired into the air to see the enemy, but \nthe shells unfortunately fell between the combatants, thereby \ngiving Oldendorf a good sight of the Japanese. The merry battle, \nwherein the Japanese ships were completely trapped, resulted \nin the almost total annihilation of the Southern Force. On the \nAmerican side, only one destroyer was severely damaged. \nThe Battle off Samar.—On October 24, when the Amer¬ \nican naval intelligence discovered that a strong Japanese force \nwas steaming for San Bernardino Strait, planes of the Third \nFleet attacked the Japanese Central Force under Admiral Kurita. \nThe enemy suffered severe losses before he could reach the strait. \nSome turned back, but the survivors doggedly proceeded to \nthe strait without having been detected by the Americans.

After a running battle, Sprague retreated toward Leyte \nGulf, still fighting with everything he had. Planes from Sprague’s \nescort carriers and torpedoes from destroyers prevented the \nJapanese from pursuing their advantage. After two and a half \nhours of intense firing on both sides, Kurita retired toward San \nBernardino Strait. With the help of aircraft from the Third \nFleet, Sprague’s escort-carrier planes pursued the enemy in the \nafternoon of October 25, sinking two heavy cruisers and one \ndestroyer. The following day, the pursuit continued, and Kurita \nsuffered one destroyer sunk and several ships damaged or sunk. \nThe Americans, too, suffered heavy losses in this engagement, \nbut Leyte Gulf was secured for the Americans. \nThe Battle off Cape Engafio.\" -The presence of two \npowerful fleets in the vicinity of Leyte Gulf led Admiral Halsey, \ncommander of the Third Fleet, to suspect that another unit of \nthe Japanese navy must be lurking around. He sent his planes \nin search of this fleet. In the afternoon of October 24, the \nplanes found the Northern Force coming from Japan. Admiral \nOzawa’s intention was to draw Admiral Halsey’s fleet from the \nvicinity of Leyte Gulf in order to allow the Central Force and \nthe Southern Force to sneak into the gulf and destroy Admiral \nSprague’s weak force. Halsey took the bait and pursued Ozawa, \nleaving San Bernardino Strait unguarded. The pursuit led Hal¬ \nsey to a point near Cape Engano in northern Luzon. The naval \nbattle off Cape Engano was fought on October 25, with planes \nand ships participating. At the moment when Halsey was \nmurdering Ozawa, he received the news that the Central Force \nhad penetrated the San Bernardino Strait and was giving Admiral \nSprague a big headache. He consequently detached fast battle¬ \nships and carriers and sent them posthaste to Leyte Gulf. This \ncontingent pursued Kurita’s fleet as it entered the San Bernardino \nStrait on its way out of the battle. On October 26, the remnants \nof the Japanese fleet were wiped out by planes of the Third \nFleet. The men of the Third Fleet, who saw Halsey dispatch \na part of his fleet to Leyte Gulf after receiving Sprague’s urgent \ncry for help, called the operation the “Battle of Bull’s Run,” \nreferring to Halsey’s familiar nickname, “Bull.” \nBy October 26, therefore, Leyte Gulf was safe in American \nhands.

This maneuver left the \nenemy at a disadvantage, for his shipping lanes through the South \nChina Sea were threatened. Carrier strikes in the Manila Bay \narea fooled the Japanese into believing that American landings \nwould be made in that area. On January 9, 1945, the Americans \nunexpectedly landed at Lingayen Gulf, thereby taking the enemy \nby surprise. The Japanese could not offer stiff resistance, parti¬ \ncularly because the number of their airplanes had dwindled \nand because it was difficult to defend the plains of Pangasinan. \nWith the enemy disconcerted, the Americans landed at San \nFabian. The liberation forces now fanned out almost without \nresistance to Central Luzon. Meanwhile, the Japanese, in des¬ \nperation, retreated to the mountains, while those in Manila \nprepared for a last-ditch battle. \nThe Liberation of Manila.--Once Mac Arthur’s forces had \nset foot on Lingayen they relentlessly moved down south. It \nwas imperative that Manila be captured without delay, for the \ncity offered excellent harbor facilities. Consequently, amphibious \noperations were carried out in Batangas; another assault force \nsucceeded in putting ashore an army corps at the San Narciso \narea in Zambales. The move was obviously designed to cut off \nthe Bataan Peninsula. By noon the troops were in Subic. Subic \nBay was secured without any opposition on January 30. \nMeanwhile in Manila, the Japanese marines began a series \nof atrocities which led to the death of thousands of the inha¬ \nbitants. The rapidity with which the American troops were \ncoming down the main highway to Manila infuriated the enemy. \nMen found in the streets were forcibly taken and compelled to \nwork in Japanese airfields or installations. Horses, carts, trucks, \nand cars were confiscated and used for transporting Japanese \nsoldiers and materials from one place to another. At least one \nhospital, the Quezon Institute, which was moved to the San Juan \nde Dios Hospital in 1942, was sacked by the Japanese and its \npatients and doctors massacred in cold blood. Houses and build¬ \nings were set on fire and their occupants shot. Manila was a city \nof conflagration. The same atrocious deeds were perpetrated"

There were \nfew Filipinos who met the Americans, for most of them were \nindoors for fear of Japanese atrocity. A tank unit promptly \nrushed to the University of Santo Tomas campus and liberated \nthe American and Allied prisoners. In the darkness of the night, \nthe prisoners, all pale shadows of their former selves, sang “God \nBless America”, followed by the “Star Spangled Banner”. In a \nmoment the night was filled with jubilant voices giving thanks \nto the Glory of God in the Highest. \nThe Return of the Commonwealth.—The heavy rains did \nnot deter the American troops from pursuing the enemy in Leyte. \nWhen it was finally determined that a large part of the island \nwas in American hands, MacArthur ordered the organization \nof civil municipal government. The temporary seat of the Com¬ \nmonwealth Government was established in Tacloban, Leyte, on \nOctober 23, 1944. On November 15, 1944, on the ninth \nanniversary of the Commonwealth, President Sergio Osmena \naddressed the Filipinos, saying in part: “The cause of democracy \nand liberty, the right of every people to govern itself and to be \nsecure against aggression, the great moral issues of justice and \nrighteousness and human dignity are being fought in the Philip¬ \npines today. I am proud of the way the American soldier is fight¬ \ning this battle. I am also proud of the way the Filipinos are \naiding in that fight.” \nOn February 27, 1945, General MacArthur, who had taken \nover the government as Military Administrator, turned over the \nreins of the civil government to President Osmena. In turning \nover the Commonwealth to Osmena, General MacArthur declared: \n* * * God has indeed blessed our arms! The girded and unleased \npower of America, supported by our Allies, turned the tide of \nbattle in the Pacific. . . culminating in the redemption of your soil \nand the liberation of your people.

The basic problem, therefore, that \nconfronted the Commonwealth and, later, the Republic, was eco¬ \nnomic. Buildings, school houses, roads, bridges, livestock, sugar \nmills, agriculture, and banking institutions had to be rehabilit¬ \nated or reconstructed. The problem of collaboration also faced \nthe government. There was confusion in the national scene; \nthe wounds of the recent war were as yet unhealed. The United \nStates gave material and financial aid to the Philippines on con¬ \ndition that the Philippine Constitution should be amended in \norder to give the Americans parity rights in the exploitation \nof the country’s natural resources. Amidst economic, social, \nand political confusion the Republic of the Philippines was bom \nto shoulder the responsibilities attendant to an independent \nexistence. \nPost-War Economic Conditions.—The ravages of war had \nleft their imprint on the economy of the country. The incomes \nof the people dipped radically and means of livelihood were \nreduced tremendously. Poverty, resulting from widespread \ndestruction of property, including work animals, was rampant \nthroughout the country. It was estimated that the damage to \ndifferent industries' amounted to about P582,500,000, while \ndomestic assets sustained a reduction of about P798,767,595. \nVarious industries suffered great losses: rice, P140,291,000; \nmining, P121,210,000; sugar, P94,590,000; and livestock, \nP81,203,000. The losses of other industries, such as lumber, \nabaca, coconut, and fishing, were inconsiderable compared with \nthe others. \nProduction was almost at a standstill in the early months \nfollowing the liberation owing to lack of capital to finance the \nrehabilitation of destroyed or partially destroyed machinery and \nother equipments. Shipping and railways were out of opera¬ \ntion resulting in very limited production and.marketing of con¬ \nsumer goods. The farms lost some 30% of their implements. \n427"

Livestock was reduced by about 65% \nresulting in the scarcity of food. Facilities for irrigating farms \nwere either destroyed or left unrepaired, and large areas of \nagricultural land were neglected. The result was limited pro¬ \nduction. \nThe total picture, then, was dismal and discouraging. The \nproblems that confronted the government and the men at its \nhelm were of such nature as to challenge the statesmanship of the \nPresident, on the one handj and the spirit of abnegation and \ncooperation of the people, on the other. \nThe Philippine Civil Affairs Unit.—Production was practically \nat a standstill when the Americans hit the beaches of Luzon. \nFood was extremely scarce. The condition became worse during \nand immediately after the battle of Manila when the people’s \nattention was centered on saving their lives not only from the \natrocities of the Japanese but also from American bombs and \nguns. Owing to this condition, the American army prompt¬ \nly created the Philippine Civil Affairs Unit (PCAU). This \nagency provided speedy relief for all the people of Manila and \nthe provinces which had been recently liberated from Japanese \nrule. First organized in New Guinea on September 28, 1944, \nthe PCAU took part in the Leyte campaigns. Its purpose was \nto assist the various military commanders in the civil adminis¬ \ntration and relief of the areas liberated. Thus clothed with this \nauthority, the PCAU paid the salaries of municipal officials and \nteachers in areas already in the hands of the Americans. The \nAmerican Government advanced the money necessary to purchase \ngoods for the relief of the suffering people. This money, how¬ \never, was subject to readjustment with the government of the \nCommonwealth as soon as military conditions permitted. \nPCAU organized food distributing centers in Manila and \nthe provinces. Rice, cracked com, sardines, salmon, and other \nAmerican canned goods were distributed free to the people. The \namount of goods distributed was based on the number of per¬ \nsons in a family. Because there was not much food to buy, \neven if one had the money, most of the heads of the families \npadded the number of persons comprising their families in order \nto get more goods. \nit \nPCAU also provided employment to laborers who were each \npaid P1.00 daily with food and PI.20 without food.

Those who could not afford to buy direct from \nthe wholesalers continued to receive relief goods. \nIn view of hoarding and the consequent rise in the prices \nof goods, President Osmena issued an Executive Order setting \nmaximum prices for goods sold in liberated areas. Thus, elon- \nelon rice was pegged at P0.32 per ganta; wheat flour, P0.15 per \nkilo; vegetable lard, P0.35 per kilo; refined brown sugar, P0.14 \nper kilo, dried fish, first class, P0.80 per kilo; second class, P0.60; \nthird class, P0.40; fourth class, P0.20; two tomatoes, P0.01, and \nso on, including prices for gabi, bananas, petroleum, shirt, drawers, \nundershirt, towel, handkerchief, haircut, etc. The Executive \nOrder, however, was good only on paper, for the prices of com¬ \nmodities in the markets were very much higher than those pro¬ \nvided for in the law. For example, eggs, which the government \npegged at P0.30 each, were selling at P0.70 in all public markets; \nbananas, whose price was set at P0.01 each, were quoted at from \nP0.10 to P0.25 each. Nevertheless, since there was money in \ncirculation the people purchased whatever was offered in the \nmarkets. There was much grumbling, of course, but the people \nhad no other alternative than to acquiesce to the whims of the \nprofiteers. \nReorganization of the Government.—As the raging fires of \nManila and the provinces subsided in the wake of the Japanese \ndefeat in the field, President Osmena reorganized the government \nto make it responsive to the imperative needs of the nation. \nOn March 7, 1945, he signed an Executive Order providing for \nthe restoration of the executive departments of the government \nas they existed before the war. The Order was, however, dated \nFebruary 27. A new feature of the reorganization was the \ncreation of the department of information as part of the Depart¬ \nment of Public Instruction. On March 8, Osmena swore in the \nnew members of the Cabinet. In a speech following the oath¬ \ntaking, Osmena outlined the principles his government would \nfollow. He said: \nWe hereby affirm our faith in, and adherence to, the principles \nof freedom and democracy.. .. \nWe shall reestablish in our country a social and political system \n. . .in which government officials and employees are not the masters \nof the people but their servants... . \nWe stand for the individual liberties, guaranteed by our Con-"

MacArthur, however, believed that Osmena was too \nslow and wanted Congress immediately convoked, for the policy \nof the American Government was to restore constitutional govern¬ \nment in the Philippines as soon as law and order had been estab¬ \nlished. On June 9, Osmena called a special session of Congress. \nManuel A. Roxas, whose ambition was to be President of the \nPhilippines, immediately spoke for the so-called collaborationists \nby declaring that all men who were employed during the Japanese \noccupation were actually loyal to the Commonwealth Govern¬ \nment. It was Roxas’ way of winning to his side the powerful \nmembers of the Nacionalista Party who worked, willingly or \nunwillingly, for the enemy. MacArthur, it seemed obvious, was \nbehind Roxas’ drive for the presidency, for he considered Roxas \nthe “man of the hour,” the “strong man” who could save the \nPhilippines in a critical period. \nOsmena, who was faced with the difficult problem of re¬ \nhabilitation and reconstruction, not to say the problem of colla¬ \nboration, wanted peace within his Nacionalista Party. Conse¬ \nquently, he offered Roxas, elected senator immediately before \nthe war, to go to Washington as Philippine Resident Commis¬ \nsioner.

In \nthe face of such political rebellion, Osmena declared that he \nwould step aside to give way to Roxas if the latter wanted to \nrun for the presidency. The way was now paved for the as¬ \ncendancy of Roxas. MacArthur, who believed that it was “im¬ \npossible to start things without calling the Philippine Congress \nto a session,” exerted pressure on Osmena. In July the President \ncalled the Congress to a regular session. \nOne of the first things the Congress did was to reward its \nmembers with three years’ back pay corresponding to the three \nyears of enemy occupation. The government employees, envy¬ \ning the legislators’ “good luck,” in turn demanded for three \nyears’ back pay. They held a demonstration at Malakanyang \nto compel Osmena to promise them back pay, but the President, \nmore realistic and honest, promised nothing, saying that there \nwas no money with which to pay the government employees. \nRoxas, however, his eyes cocked to the presidency, promised \nthat if elected he would recommend the passage of a Back Pay \nLaw. The Law, approved in 1948, promised to give three years’ \nback pay to all pre-war government employees after the end of \na ten-year period, that is, in 1958. \nThe Collaboration Issue.—Osmena faced the problem of \ncollaboration with an open mind. But the line of conduct he \nwas to follow with regard to the question was laid down for \nhim by President Roosevelt when, on June 29, 1944, the latter \nstated that those who collaborated with the enemy should be \nremoved “from authority and influence over the political and \neconomic life of the country.” Consequently, when Congress \nwas convened to a special session on August 14, at least two \nbills were presented providing for the creation of a court to try \nthe so-called collaborators. Osmena, however, realizing that the \nbills were unsatisfactory, presented an administration measure \nproviding for a court whose judges were not identified with the \nso-called collaborators. The Roxas faction in Congress maneu¬ \nvered to have the Osmena bill toned down. There were heated \ndiscussions on the bill. On September 11, American Secretary \nof the Interior Harold Ickes reminded Osmena, in a cablegram, \nof the late President Roosevelt’s policy regarding collaboration \nin his statement of June 29, 1944. There was a hint of with¬ \ndrawal of American aid when he said that “I would call atten¬ \ntion of your Government to the probable reluctance with which \nfunds may be appropriated for relief, rehabilitation and support"

It was thus that the Osrnena bill, with \nsome modifications, was passed. \nIn September 1945, the American agency, the Counter-In¬ \ntelligence Corps (CIC), handed over to the Commonwealth Gov¬ \nernment all the detained political prisoners. Some of them, big \nnames in the Philippine political scene before the war, were \nset free upon the suggestions of both Osrnena and Roxas. Mean¬ \nwhile, the People’s Court, which handled all cases of collabora¬ \ntion, tried the various cases brought before it. Some were found \nguilty and imprisoned, but the others were not. As the facts of \ncollaboration came to light, the people, who were at first swayed \nby passion in their judgment of the issue, now slowly realized \nthat the “collaboration” of many of the officials in the Laurel \nGovernment was intended to soften the impact of the Japanese \nmilitary administration. With the publication of Senator Claro \nM. Recto’s brilliant book, Three Years of Enemy Occupation, in \n1946, the cause of those who wanted all collaborators jailed \nwas weakened. When Roxas won the presidency in 1946 he solved \nthe collaboration issue by proclaiming amnesty to all political \nprisoners. He had no alternative, for he was himself a “colla¬ \nborator”, having been active in Laurel’s Government. Senator \nRecto refused to be amnestied, believing in the justice of his \ncause. He fought his legal battles with the People’s Court and \nwon an acquittal. \nAmerican Financial Aid.—The general economic situation \narising from the ravages of the war led the American Govern¬ \nment to survey the actual damage inflicted by the enemy on \nthe Philippines. Consequently, Senator Millard Tydings, co¬ \nauthor of the Tydings-McDuffie Independence Act, was sent \nto the Philippines to make the survey. Tydings arrived in Ma¬ \nnila on May 23, 1945 and intended to stay for four weeks. A \nmisunderstanding with MacArthur led Tydings to conclude his \nmission after a few days’ stay. Upon his return to the United \nStates, Tydings recommended that the Philippines be given \n$100,000,000 for rehabilitation and reconstruction. Moreover, \nhe recommended that the pre-war trade i lations between the \nPhilippines and the United States be continued for a period of \nfrom three to five years. Measures were then enacted by the"

It \nvoted for $120,000,000 for the rehabilitation of public buildings, \nroads, and bridges. To put Philippine finance on a sound basis, \nthe American Congress also passed a law providing for $75,000,000 \nfor budgetary purposes and another $25,000,000 for the \nredemption of guerrilla notes used as currency of the guerrillas \nduring the occupation. On top of this, the American Army \nsurplus, worth one billion dollars but with a sale value of PI 00,- \n000,000, was turned over to the Philippine Government. For \nreconstruction purposes, the United States Reconstruction and \nFinance Corporation granted a loan of $60,000,000 to the \nPhilippines. \nThe Bell Trade and Rehabilitation Acts.—The proclama¬ \ntion of Philippine independence on July 4, 1946 was a settled \nmatter. There was no opposition from across the Pacific. But \nthe matter of future trade relations was given some thought \nby American leaders. On September 26, 1945, Congressman C. \nJasper Bell of Missouri introduced a bill providing for free trade \nrelations between the United States and the Philippines for a \nperiod o* twenty years. The bill was opposed in some quarters \nas being prejudicial to the preparation of the Philippines for \nindependence. Senator Tydings ^escribed the bill as opposed \nto independence and that its proponents were in fa\\ or of keeping \n“the Philippines economically” a colony of the United States. \nJasper Bell, however, wa& not dismayed. In October, he in¬ \ntroduced another bill providing for an eight-year free trade \nrelations with the United States. After much discussions, the \nbill was approved. \nThe bill, known as the Bell Trade Relations Act, provided \nfor free-trade relations between the United States and the Phil¬ \nippines until 1954, after which goods coming from the United \nStates end from the Philippines would be taxed five per cent \ntariff increase every year until the full 100% was reached in \n1974. The bad feature of the law was the provision giving \n“parity’ rights to the Americans, that is to say, *he Americans \nwould have the right to dispose, exploit, develop, and utilize \n“all agricultural, timber, and mineral lands” of the Philippines, \ntogether with the operation of public utilities and the exploita¬ \ntion of the “waters, minerals, coal, petroleum, an^ mineral re¬ \nsources cf the Philippines.” This particular provision meant \nthat the Filipinos .vould ha\"re to amend the Constitution which \nprovides that only corporations of which the Filipinos owned"

President Truman signed \nthe bill into a law on April 30, 1946. The Rehabilitation Act \nprovided for an outlay of $620,000,000 to be given to those who \nsuffered damage during the war. But a condition was attached \nto the payment of war damage: that no amount in excess of \n$500 would be given unless and until an agreement had been \nreached by the Presidents of the Philippines and the United \nStates regarding trade relations between the two countries. The \neffectivity of the Rehabilitation Act was conditioned by the \namendment of the Philippine Constitution in such a way as to \ngive “parity” rights to the Americans. It is obvious that the \nUnited States would help her most loyal ally only if the Amer¬ \nicans would be granted the same rights as the Filipinos enjoy \nin the exploitation of the natural resources of the country. The \nUnited States, then, played the role of a man who, having been \naided by a friend who lost everything in defense of the former, \nnow brashly demanded that he be given the right to live with \nhis friend’s wife in exchange for his financial help. \nThe Election of 1946.- When Mac Arthur returned to the Phil¬ \nippines the officials of the Laurel Government were forcibly \ntaken by the Japanese. Some of them were taken to Baguio \nin the wake of the retreating Japanese army, while others were \nflown to Japan. Manuel A. Roxas, elected senator in the election \nof November 1941, was one of those taken to Baguio. Mac- \nArthur, a friend of Roxas, ordered his men to liberate Roxas. \nOnce liberated, Roxas proceeded to maneuver for his election \nto the presidency. To create a good impression on the minds \nof the electorate, MacArthur issued a statement clearing Roxas \nof any taint of collaboration with the enemy. To put Roxas \nbefore the attention of the public and at the same time to give \nhim sufficient power to counteract Osmena, who, MacArthur \nbelieved, was too slow, the American general applied pressure \non Osmena to call Congress to a regular session. Osmena did \nnot believe in the wisdom of calling Congress to session, for he \nfeared that the legislative body might fall into the hands of per¬ \nsons tainted with collaboration. Nevertheless, he had to give \nin to MacArthur whose reputation was enough to cow him into \nsubmission."

As head of this powerful body, \nRoxas harassed Osmena by either sitting on or disapproving \nPresident Osmena’s nominations to important positions in the \ngovernment. The heavy burden of state and his delicate health \nled Osmena to the conclusion that it was time for him to retire. \nHe made his announcement to his men, saying that if Roxas \nwanted to be the President he, Osmena, would be graceful enough \nto give way to the younger Roxas. Roxas himself was not in \ngood health, and this fact led him to believe that now was the \ntime to become President. Osmena’s men wanted him to continue \nto serve the country and so persuaded him to run for the Presi¬ \ndency. Thus, the Nacionalista Party was split in two factions: \n“the Osmena faction and the Roxas faction. \nOn January 4, 1946, Congress met in a special session and \nset the election on April 23. Roxas began strengthening the \nmachinery of his faction, which was named the Liberal Wing \nof the Nacionalista Party. Several factors favored Roxas. On \nthe positive side, he was younger, a go-getter, brilliant, an ef¬ \nfective orator, and backed up by Mac Arthur, Paul V. McNutt, \nthe American High Commissioner to the Philippines, and Mrs. \nAurora Aragon Quezon, the late President’s wife. Moreover, \nRoxas had a paramount issue against the Osmena Administra¬ \ntion, namely, the graft and corruption in the government. On \nthe negative side, Osmena was a passive man who, many peo¬ \nple believe, was “too slow” in the face of a national crisis. \nMoreover, he refused to go out to campaign and satisfied him¬ \nself with saying that the people knew his forty years of honest \nand faithful service to the country. The people, of course, knew \nall this, but they missed the magic of his personality in numerous \nmeetings throughout the country, while, on the other hand, \nthey were transfixed by the fiery oratory of Roxas who promised \nto bring heaven to earth. The people, who had had enough \nof conditions reminiscent of the Japanese occupation, refused \nto heed the warnings of the pro-Osmena camp that Roxas was \na collaborationist and should, therefore, not be elected. They \npreferred, instead, beautiful promises of heaven and, conse¬ \nquently, catapulted Roxas to the presidency. Carried along \nwith Roxas were his running mate, Elpidio Quirino, and a ma¬ \njority of the Liberal candidates for senator and representative. \nWith Roxas’ victory, the Liberal Wing of the Nacionalista Party \nassumed a new color and became the Liberal Party."

The so-called guerrilla problem consisted in the abuses \nallegedly committed by many guerrillas during the enemy occu¬ \npation. When the courts of justice had been re-established, many \ncriminal complaints were filed against the guerrillas who were \ncharged with murder, rape, kidnapping, and robbery during the \nthree years of Japanese occupation. The court dockets were \nclogged with these cases, and the guerrillas naturally looked up \nto Roxas as their savior. On September 7, 1946, Roxas pro¬ \nclaimed a general amnesty of those guerrillas who killed and"

However, \nthose who kidnapped, murdered, and otherwise confiscated \nproperty not in pursuance of the objectives of the guerriPa \nmovement were not included in the amnesty. “It is not only \nunjust,” Roxas said in his message to Congress explaining his \namnesty proclamation, “but most ungrateful on the part of our \nRepublic to allow these brave and patriotic men to be subjected \nto the indignity of a criminal prosecution for acts which they \ncommitted in their heroic endeavors to resist the enemy and to \nhelp in winning the war. Most of these accused men deserve \nrather to be hailed as heroes for the commission of such acts.” \nThus, with one stroke of the pen, Roxas solved the guerrilla \nproblem to the satisfaction of those who, during abnormal con¬ \nditions, liquidated or ordered the liquidation of men and women \nbelieved,- rightly or wrongly, to have committed acts inimical \nto the resistance movement. \nThe Treaty of General Relations.—Immediately after the \nindependence ceremonies, the Philippines, now a Republic, and \nthe United States entered into a treaty of general relations. In \naccordance with this treaty, the United States withdrew and \nsurrendered “all rights of possession, supervision, jurisdiction, \ncontrol or sovereignty” over the Philippines, except such bases \nas the United States would need for the mutual protection of \nthe United States and the Philippines. Pending the establish¬ \nment of Philippine diplomatic service abroad, the United States \nwould represent the interests of the Philippines “in countries \nwhere there is no Philippine representation.” On the other hand, \nthe Philippines agreed to assume all debts of the cities, munici¬ \npalities, provinces, and instrumentalities deemed valid and sub¬ \nsisting on July 4, 1946. Moreover, the Philippines agreed to \nassume all obligations the United States had assumed after the \nconclusion of the Treaty of Paris between the United States and \nSpain, December 10,1898. \nThe treaty, then, the first to be concluded by the Republic \nof the Philippines, was entered into by the United States in order \nto recognize Philippine independence officially. \nThe Plebiscite of 1947.—The election of 1946 resulted not \nonly in the return to* power of the pre-war lords of Philippine \neconomy, but also, as a reaction against such a comeback, in \nthe election of six Democratic Alliance men, headed by Luis \nTaruc of Pampanga, to Congress.

The presence of Taruc and other \nelected Congressmen belonging to the Democratic Alliance, a \nparty composed of non-collaborators, intellectuals, and peasants, \nposed a danger to the passage in Congress of a law amending \nthe Constitution in order to give parity rights to the Americans. \nWith these six and other Congressmen and Senators against parity \nrights President Roxas and his men might not get the necessary \nthree-fourths majority to amend the Constitution. Upon the \ninstigation of Roxas, Congress passed a resolution unseating \nTaruc and his Democratic Alliance colleagues from Congress. \nThe ostensible ground for expulsion was the alleged electoral \nfrauds and terrorism committed by the Hukbalahaps in Central \nLuzon which resulted in the election of six candidates of the \nDemocratic Alliance and one Nacionalista. With the expulsion \nof Taruc and his companions, the way was paved for the Congress \nresolution agreeing to amend the Constitution. \nOn March 11, 1947, Congress submitted to the people the \nfollowing draft amending the Constitution: \n... the disposition, exploitation, development, and utilization \nof all agricultural, timber, and mineral lands of the public domain, \nwaters, minerals, coal, petroleum, and other natural resources of \nthe Philippines, and the operation of public utilities, shall, if open \nto any person, be open to citizens of the United States and to all \nforms of business enterprises owned or controlled, directly or in¬ \ndirectly, by citizens of the United States.... \nRoxas and his men went to the people to explain the “bless¬ \nings” of American exploitation of the natural resources of the \ncountry and painted a dream picture of wealth, contentment, \npeace, and prosperity in the wake of such exploitation.

They \ndelivered speeches assailing the wisdom of amending the Con¬ \nstitution, the sacred document of the land, in order to give the \nAmericans equal rights with the Filipinos in the exploitation \nof the natural resources of the country. They pointed out that \nthe very Constitution intended to be amended provided in the \nPreamble that the “patrimony of the nation” shall be conserved \nand developed by Filipinos. But the people were more impressed \nby Roxas’ magic oratory and promises than with Recto’s and \nLaurel’s far-sightedness. In the plebiscite, the hungry people, \ndreaming of a promised prosperity at the expense of national \ndignity, ratified the amendment. The years that followed showed \n* up Roxas’ demagoguery and lack of vision: the country remained \nas poor as ever and the promised prosperity “in the glistening \nwake of America” has to this day remained a will-o’-the-wisp. \nDeath Came for Roxas.—Roxas was sincere when he out¬ \nlined his program of rehabilitation and reconstruction. There \nwas, in fact, too much sincerity in him that he would go to any \nlength to be the architect of the Philippines’ rise to a prosperous \nstatus. The basis of that material prosperity for which he and \nhis countrymen were laboring was close friendship with the \nUnited States no matter what happened. He was that naive. \nThe world of 1948 was in turmoil. The Berlin Crisis was \ncoming to a head with the Soviet Union creating trouble spots \nall over Europe in order to weaken the democracies. In Asia, \nChiang Kai-shek was on the verge of collapse and the communist \narmy of Chu Teh was trampling upon the Nationalist Chinese’s \nopposition with contemptuous disregard for human life. The \nUnited States, the spearhead of the democracies, was looking \nin all directions for allies. What more propitious moment than \nthe present to gauge Roxas’ loyalty to the United States? \nSo, in March 1948, the military authorities of Clark Air \nBase invited Roxas to make a public statement on the loyalty \nof the Philippines to the United States.

At 9:30, while an American army officer \nwas passing by the foot of the President’s bed, he noticed that \nRoxas made a sudden gasp. In a few minutes, President Roxas \nwas dead. Two days later, Vice-President Elpidio Quirino took \nhis oath of office as President of the Philippines. \nQuirino’s Administration.—Quirino was suffering from high \nblood pressure and was “taking it easy” in a boat cruising the \nVisayan waters when he received the news of Roxas’ unexpected \ndeath. Upon assuming office, Quirino, who inherited the grave \nproblems of the State, announced that his program of government \nwould consist in restoring the faith and confidence of the people \nin the government and in the restoration of peace and order. \nThe first part of the program was based on the realization that \nthe people had lost their confidence in the government owing \nto the rampant graft and corruption of the Liberal Party’s hench¬ \nmen and favorites. The second part was based on the pathetic \nlack of peace and order not only in the cities, but also in the \ncountryside. The Hukbalahaps of Taruc had gone underground \nand refused to surrender their arms. The Military Police and \nCivilian Guards, on the other hand, were on a rampage kidnapping \nand killing suspected persons without due process of law. On \ntop of this, production was slow and unemployment was increas¬ \ning with unheard of proportions. \n/ \nQuirino surveyed the field with a critical eye and summed \nup his program of government, as follows: government reorgan¬ \nization to achieve efficiency at all levels of the bureaucracy, \nimmediate increased production to give employment to thousands \nof idle laborers, vigorous and honest enforcement of tax laws, \nthe preservation of the national integrity, and continued friendly \nrelations with the countries of the world."

Nevertheless, \nthe seeds of revolt were planted in the minds of tne peasants. \nIn the nineteenth century, Filipino landlordism rose and, with \nit, more abuses. The agrarian problem, far from being solved, \nbecame acute. It was not until the coming- of the Americans \nthat certain reforms were initiated to lessen the tension between \ntenants and landlords. But the reforms were palliative in nature \nand did not actually solve the problem. With political conscious¬ \nness, the peasants were united by educated but poor leaders. \nThe most potent of these peasant organizations was the Huk¬ \nbalahap, which began as a resistance organization against the \nJapanese and ended as a movement against the government. \nSpanish Origins.—-There is no record of any agrarian unrest \nin pre-Spanish times; the unrest, in so far as records are concerned, \ndates from the Spanish period when the encomienda was estab¬ \nlished about 1570. High taxes, coupled with unspeakable abuses \nconnected therewith, led to widespread discontent among the \npeople. Theoretically, the encomienda was an excellent insti¬ \ntution designed to protect the people from exploitation and to \neducate them in the Christian faith. Actually, however, it was \nused as a tool of exploitation by the rapacious encomenderos. \nThe people were dispossessed of the land upon which they staked \ntheir very lives. Such a feudal setup led to the widening of the \ngap between the ruling class and the people. To make their rule \nmore effective in so far as economic exploitation was concerned, \nthe Spanish officials and friars bestowed little favors on the \ndescendants of the Filipino rajahs and nobles by making the \nlatter a sort of middlemen between the rulers and the ruled. \nThe result was more and more exploitation of the poorer class \nby both the Spaniards and their Filipino stooges.

On the contrary, the friars ex¬ \npanded their estates with the Filipinos continuing as tenants \nand agricultural workers. A small number of Filipino tenants, \nhowever, turned lessees and became economically well off. In \nthe nineteenth century, they constituted the Filipino landed \naristocracy. \nBut while an exceedingly small number of Filipinos became \nprosperous, the great bulk of the people became serfs. The \npeasants remained illiterate and were burdened with heavy taxes \nand other unjust and iniquitous impositions which made life \nunbearable for them. The upshot was agrarian unrest, which \nexploded into uprisings and revolts through out the country. \nThese uprisings were suppressed ruthlessly, for the government \nwas in unholy alliance with the Spanish landlords. \nThe life of the peasant during the Spanish period was charac¬ \nterized by absolute penury and degradation. The customary \ndivision of the crops was 50-50, with the peasants furnishing \nthe tools and work animals. Under the setup the peasant earned \nno more than twenty pesos a year. On top of this, he was in¬ \nvariably the victim of his landlord’s rapacity: he was compelled \nto borrow money from his landlord at an exorbitant interest. \nThe result was that the peasant became heavily indebted to the \nlandlord. This indebtedness was inherited by the peasant’s \nchildren and children’s children, thereby pinning them down, \nincluding the unborn generation, to the land without any hope \nof release from servitude. This inhumanity to man was com¬ \npounded by making the peasant work for the landlord without \npay. The peasant’s chickens, too, were for the landlord. His \nchildren were the servants of the landlord, who never had the \nheart to pay them a single centavo. \nUnder such conditions, the peasant had no other recourse \nthan to gamble. His fatalism made him take a chance a cock- \nfighting to increase his income. In this, as in the other forms \nof gambling, only the owner of the cockpit benefited from the \nsoltadas or fights, because a certain percentage of the bets was"

Of these factors, the most important was economic: the \ncruelties, thievery, and injustices of the Spanish officials and \nfriars were perpetrated in order to amass wealth and, with it, \npower. Having tasted wealth and power, they tried their best \nto maintain the status quo, on the one hand, and to subvert \nany movement for reforms, on the other. In the last two decades \nof the nineteenth century, the Filipino middle class rose to \nprominence and initiated the reform movement. Such a move¬ \nment necessarily resulted in a social tension, for the Spanish \nruling class, highly suspicious of any movement that would cur¬ \ntail their vested interests, refused to give in to the demands of \nthe Filipino reformist group. The tension snapped when, in \n1896, the masses, led by Andres Bonifacio, took to the field \nagainst the Spanish oppressors.

In either case, the \npeasant was the loser. \nIn the pasunod, the peasant was forced to borrow from his \nlandlord whether he liked it or not. The same technique was \nemployed as in the takalanan. In the baligtaran, the palay was \nconverted into money at, say, one peso per cavan at the time \nthe loan was made. At harvest time, the value of the palay was \nincreased or decreased so as to favor the landlord. Such practices \nadded to the misery of the peasant. The realization of their \nlowly condition and the failure of the government to stop the \ncaciques from their nefarious practices led to uprisings in Luzon \nin 1931 and in 1935. J. Ralston Hayden, former Acting Governor \nGeneral of the Philippines and a close student of Philippine \naffairs, said: \nI doubt, however, if you could find ten Americans in the \nIslands who do not believe that the poor peasants who rose against \nconstituted authority at Tayug (Pangasinan) were rebelling chiefly \nagainst “caciquism”, agrarian oppression, and Constabulary abuses. \nOne Filipino newspaper strongly expressed this view, and Tomas \nConfesor, the ever outspoken Director of the Bureau of Commerce \nand Industry, told his people that this was the case, adding that \ndangerous discontent based upon oppression and injustice existed \nover large areas of the plain of Central Luzon. \nThe Rise of Socialism and Communism.--Any movement"

The freedoms \nthat the United States brought to the Philippines led to a political \nconsciousness which seeped through the minds of the peasants \nand workers. Labor and peasart leaders appeared and united the \nunwieldy peasants and laborers into unions. The awakening of \nthe exploited class came during the first decade of American \nrule when labor and peasant unions sprouted overnight. In this \nawakening, Tagalog novels played a significant part. Lope K. \nSantos’ Banaag at Sikat (Rays and Sunrise), first published serially \nin the nationalistic Muling Pagsilang and, in 1906, published \nin book form, brought the socialist tenets before the view of the \nlaborers and the peasants. This was followed later oy Faustino \nAguilar’s Busabos ng Palad (Slave of Fate, 1907) and Nangalunod \nsa Katihan (Drowned in the Beach, 1911) which described the \npoor peasants and their rapacious landlords. In 1936 Servando \nde los Angeles, in the wake of labor strikes and the peasant move¬ \nment, published his novel Ang Hiding Tirnawu (The Last Serf) \nwhich was obviously an anti-landlord work. \nThese various influences—the freedoms, political conscious¬ \nness, and the role of the socialistic novels — led to a more \naggressive movement of the lower class. In 1922, the peasants \nbanded themselves into the Confederation ue Aparceros y \nObreros Agricolas de Filipinos (Philippine Confederation of \nTenants and Agricultural Workers), under the leadership of Jacinto \nManahan. Two years later, it was re-named Katipunang Pambansa \nng mga Magbubukid sa Pilipinas (National Peasants’ Union of the \nPhilippines). This union and the Philippine Labor Congress \nbecame the most powerful weapons of the lower class in their \nfight for reforms beneficial to their class. \nIn 1928, representatives of the Philippine Labor Congress \nattended a trade conference in Canton, China, which was spon¬ \nsored by the communists. Upon their return, they founded the \nLabor Party. In the same year, the Philippine Labor Congress \naffiliated itself with the Red International (Organization) of \nLabor Unions, thereby making the PLC a communist union. \nThe following year, 1929, the conservative and the communist \nleaders of the PLC disagreed on matters of policy, and Crisanto \nEvangelista, a communist, founded his Katipunan ng mga Anak- \npawis ng Pilipinas (Congress of Philippine Workingmen), while \nthe other leaders, Ruperto S.

The \navowed purposes of the new party were to work for the im¬ \nprovement of the living and working conditions of the workers \nand peasants, the overthrow of the American colonial govern¬ \nment and the establishment of an independent Philippines pat¬ \nterned after Soviet Russia, and to unite all workers. At first the \ncommunists were allowed to work unhampered, but in 1932 \nthe Supreme Court declared the Communist Party an illegal as¬ \nsociation. Though outlawed, the jCommunist Party worked se¬ \ncretly among the peasants and laborers, particularly of Central \nLuzon. \nIn 1929, Pedro Abad Santos, a wealthy and cultured land¬ \nlord of Pampanga, founded the Socialist Party. The following \nyear, he founded the Aguman Ding Maldang Talapagobra \n(Workers’ and Peasants’ Union) or, more simply, AMT. Both \nthe Socialist Party and the AMT were aspects of the same move¬ \nment, whose purpose was to secure better conditions and in¬ \ncreased pay for the workers and peasants. The Socialist Party \nacted as the political arm of the Union. \nThe Socialist Party did not become widespread and popular \nuntil after 1932. It was not, however, outlawed, for it did not \nadvocate the overthrow of the existing government. But while \nthe Communist Party members, having been outlawed, remained \nin the underground, the Socialists worked openly for important \nreforms. In 1938, when the Communist leaders who were im¬ \nprisoned in 1932 were pardoned, the two parties — the Commnist \nand the Socialist — merged. Thus, the peasants and workers \nof Central Luzon, while not actually communists, were never¬ \ntheless members of an organization whose leaders were avowed \ncommunists. This affiliation of the peasants and workers of \nCentral Luzon with a communist organization made them the \nmost politically sophisticated working class in the Philippines. \nThe Founding of the Hukbalahap.- The socialist-communist \norientation of the Central Luzon peasants led to a more militant \npeasant and labor movement. The years immediately preceding \nthe outbreak of the war in the Pacific may be described as critical, \nfor it was during that period that numerous strikes were recorded. \nIt was also the same period that saw the murder of the millionaire"

Instinctively, the peasants of \nPampanga reacted sharply by forming home guards for their \nprotection and security. The realities of war imposed a certain \ndegree of discipline on the peasants. The necessity for a unified \nmovement that would, on the one hand, keep the morale of \nthe people at the highest level and, on the other, face the Japanese \nenemy, led to a meeting of peasant leaders early in February \n1942. The meeting, held at the barrio of Bakwit, Cabiao, Nueva \nEcija, was attended by Luis Taruc, Juan Feleo, Casto Alejandrino, \nMatelo del Castillo, F. Sampanga, Jose de Leon, Lino Dizon, Euse¬ \nbio Aquino and Mariano Franco. The conferees decided upon “united \nfront” tactics, that is to say, the winning over to their movement \nof the moderate landlords and the middle class, with the peasants \nand workers leading and directing the movement. “Anti-Japanese \nAbove All” became the battlecry of the peasant underground \nmovement. The peasant organizations were then dissolved in \norder to carry out their main policy, namely, to work for a free \nand democratic Philippines. \nTo carry out this policy, the peasant leaders adopted a three- \npoint plaftform: economic, political, and military. The economic \nphase of the peasant underground struggle consisted in the develop¬ \nment of -all means of providing the people with sustenance and \nat the same to sabotage Japanese efforts to “loot the country.” \nThe political phase consisted in discrediting the “puppet regime” \nand in destroying its influence. The military aim was to harass \nthe Japanese. Immediately thereafter, the peasants began collect¬ \ning all sorts of arms in preparation for a vast resistance movement. \nWith the policies and principles laid down, the peasant leaders \nmet at a clearing in the forest that joined the provinces of Tarlac, \nPampanga, and Nueva Ecija, on March 29, 1942. A table stood \nin the clearing and before it were gathered all units of the peasant \nresistance movement. For one week the leaders discussed \ncommon problems. When the name for the vast organization \ncame up for discussion, the men unanimously agreed to call it \nHukbo ng Bay an Laban sa Hapdn or HUKBALAHAP, for short. \nThere were speeches, all directed against the Japanese and the"

After the meeting, \na Military Committee was formed, with the following as members: \nTame, Banal (Bernardo Poblete), Casto Alejandrino, and Felipa \nCulala (Dayang-Payang), an Amazon whose unit had recently \nkilled several Japanese soldiers. Tame was chosen chairman of \nthe committee, with Alejandrino as second in command. Thus \nthe birth of the Hukbalahap. \nThe Hukbalahap Sovereignty.--The high command of the \nHukbalahap imposed an iron discipline on all its members. There \nwas no excuse for deviation from the rigidity of the mles and \nregulations that made the movement the most disciplined and \npowerful in the country, during the enemy occupation. That this \ndiscipline was real can be gauged from the execution of Dayang- \nDayang (Felipa Culala) by her own men when it appealed that \nshe was endangering the movement by her deviation from the \nrules of the organization. There is no accurate list of men li¬ \nquidated by the Hrkbalahap in the name of unity, but it is pro¬ \nbably safe to assume that hundreds vrere killed. Among them \nwere non-members who were suspected of giving aid and comfort \nto the enemy. The unity and the discipline of the men and \nwomen under the influence of the Hukbalahap made Central \nLuzon and a few other provinces outside the region a Huk terri¬ \ntory. The towns and the municipal government were in the hands \nof the Huks who saw to it that peace and order reigned their \nrespective areas. \nWhen war broke out and the Japanese occupied the coun¬ \ntry, the landlords and their families evacuated to Manila. The \npeasants took over the land of the absentee landlords. This was \nthe beginning of a new era for them: they had freedom and \nthere was plenty of food. Many of the landlords, who had been \naccustomed to pushing the peasants around and to exploiting \nthem, refused to return to their provinces for fear of being liqui¬ \ndated by the Huks. Such a situation naturally led to secret ill \nfeeling toward the Huks, while the latter, on the other hand, \nfelt that their landlords had it coming to them and deserved \ntheir fate. This mutual feeling of hatred, as will be seen later, \nexploded into armed skirmishes which were bloody enough to \nbe narrated in detail. \nOne who had lived in Central Luzon during the enemy oc¬ \ncupation cannot fail to observe the effectiveness of the Huk \nresistance movement.

So effective \nwas the Huk resistance movement that the Japanese feared them \nmore than they did the other guerrilla units. Thus the Central \nPlains became a Huk preserve, and while outwardly the Japanese \nwere in command, actually the area recognized Huk sovereignty. \nLiberation and Imprisonment.—The American landing in \nLingayen in January 1945 was opportune, for the guerrillas \nhad already cleared out the Japanese obstacles. The Huks, as \nthe most potent guerrilla outfit, had the straggling Japanese \nin flight. In mid-January they liberated much of Tarlac, and \non the 20th they assaulted and captured the capital of the prov¬ \nince. They hoisted the Filipino and American flags and waited \nfor the arrival of the first American contingents. Meanwhile, \nsome squadrons attacked the towns of Pampanga, including \nSan Fernando, and immediately placed them under their ad \nministration. Municipal government immediately functioned \nunder Huk auspices, and on January 28, 1945 Casto Alejandrino \nwas “elected” provisional governor of Pampanga. In Nueva \nEcija, Juan Feleo was “elected” governor.

Successively, \nthe Huks in Obando and Maykaway an, Bulakan, were also dis¬ \narmed tor no reason at all. Further indignity was heaped upon \nthe Huks when Squadron 77, while passing through Malolos \non their way to Pampanga, was waylaid by the men under Colonel \nAdonais Maclang of Malolos, Bulakan, seized, thrown into jail, \nand shot to death with the knowledge of the American MP’s. \nTogether with the unlisted men who had joined the Squadron \nearlier there were probably 160 men in all, of whom only thirty \nlived to tell the grim story. Maclang was later appointed mayor \nof Malolos. \nAlmost simultaneously, the Americans, fo no apparent \nreasons, arrested Huk leader “Linda Bie” (Silvestre Liwanag) \nwho had, witL his Squadrons, helped the Americans in the cap¬ \nture of the Floridablanca airfields.

Meanwhile, the \nPhilippine Civil Affairs Unit (PCAU) of the American Army \nproceeded to remove all municipal officials elected by the Huks \nand replaced them with USAFFE guerrillas, who were the keen \nrivals of the Huks. There followed a series of arrests and of \ndisarming of the Huks; they were imprisoned by the American \nCounter-Jntelligence Corps (CIC). An American Air Corps Colonel, \nGwen G.

One of those arrested was Luis Taruc. \nThere was, naturally, bitterness among the peasants, for no formal \ncharges were preferred against the Huk leaders.

Here Taruc mixed with the high officials of Laurel’s \ngovernment who were branded collaborators by the CIC and \njailed. It is significant to note that neither MacArthur nor the \nrival guerrilla units were able to file charges of crimes against \nTaruc hnd his men. The Huks accused the USAFFE guerrillas \nof poisoning the minds of the Americans against them and of \nactually intriguing to have them liquidated by the Americans. \nMore significantly, Taruc accused the landlords of'having insti¬ \ngated the move against the Huks in order to w *ak vengeance \non them, and primarily to disorganize the Huk movement for \ntheir (landlords’) benefit.

This fact is crucial in \nassessing the Huk movement, for such arrests and imprisonment — \ndone rightly or wrongly — led the Huks to suspect that there was \na concerted move to liquidate them and to force them into a way \nof life under the aegis of the landlords. The imprisonment of \nTaruc gave rise to a wave of discontent among the peasants and \nthe liberal intellectuals. On September 23, 1945, some 50,000 \npeasants and workers marched to Malakanyang and demanded \nthe release of Taruc and his companions. Two days later, GY \nwas released.

Roxas, in his \nattempt to assure himself of the presidency and knowing the \nvoting potential of the Huks, wooed Taruc and promised him \nalmost everything if Taruc and the Huks would side with him ' \nin the coming political struggle. “I am more radical than you \nare, you know,” Roxas was reported to have told Taruc in a \ndesperate attempt to win over the Huks to his side. Taruc, \nhowever, refused to truckle to Roxas, who was reported to be \nthe candidate of the wealthiest men of the country. That was \nthe beginning of Roxas’ hostility to the Huks.

The same wanton disregard for civil rights \nwas exhibited by the MP’s in Maliwalu, Bacolor, Pampanga. A \ngroup of men and women was holding a party at night when they \nwere fired upon and killed by the MP’s. Yet there is no evidence \nthat the criminals in MP uniform were punished for their crimes. \nNo wonder, then, that the Huks refused to come to terms with \nthe government but continued, instead to defy duly constituted \nauthorities. \nSignificant, too, was Roxas’ act in masterminding the un¬ \nseating of Tame and the other members of the Democratic Al¬ \nliance who had been elected to Congress.

It was also believed that the purpose in each instance \nwas to deprive the peasants of leadership in order to make it \neasy for the government to deal with them. \nOutlawing of the Huks.—The sharp and constant fighting \nbetween the Huks on one hand, and the MP’s and civilian guards, \non the other, wrought havoc on the agricultural economy of \nCentral Luzon. The people, placed in the cross-fire of two con¬ \ntending forces, lived in fear and hunger. Seasonal harvests de¬ \ncreased tremendously, resulting in the spiraling of the prices \nof commodities. For two years, the Roxas Administration tried \nits best to quell the Huk dissidence to no avail. It seemed that \nthe people were behind the Huks and were prepared to give aid \nand comfort to their leaders. One MP report would say that \nTaruc was within the clutches of the government forces; the fol¬ \nlowing day the newspaper reports would say that Taruc was no¬ \nwhere to be found.

As a first step toward the realization of \nthe first objective, Quirino sent his brother, former Judge An¬ \ntonio Quirino, to the field to contact Taruc in order to know \nwhat the Huks wanted.

The latter, however, in an open \nletter to Tame, denied any such “secret agreement” was talked \nabout between him and Tame.

This Taruc did \nnot want to happen. Taruc, therefore, suspected, rightly or \nwrongly, that the Quirino Administration was acting in bad \nfaith when it refused to give the peasants on-the-spot permits \nfor possessing firearms which they needed badly for their self- \ndefense.

General Rafael Jalandoni, who was with \nthe Quezon party, accused the Huks of having perpetrated the \ndastardly crime, but General Alberto Ramos, Chief of the Con¬ \nstabulary, contended that bandits, not the Huks, were responsible \nfor the death of Mrs. Quezon and others in the party.

As long as imperialism and feudalism dominates [mc] our \ncountry, there will always be misery for the toiling masses which \nconstitutes [s/c] 95% of our population.

Rumors \ncirculated in Manila that the Huks could take the city any time \nthey wanted and that it would not be long before the Manila \npopulace would wake up one morning to find Malakanyang in \nthe hands of the Huks. Strict security measures were then taken \nby the government to forestall any such Huk movement; searches \nwere made in domiciles of suspected Huks and liberal intellectuals; \narbitrary arrests were made and suspects were taken to Camp \nMurphy and there punished bodily. Meanwhile, Secretary of \nNational Defense Ramon Magsaysay adopted a policy of attraction \nin order to win over the dissidents to the side of the government. \nPresident Quirino, in his desire to re-established peace and order, \nbacked up his Defense Secretary and gave him the necessary \nfunds to carry out the administration program of rehabilitating \nthe surrendered Huks. At the same time, the Military Intelligence \nService (MIS) of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) \nworked day and night to track down the nerve center of the Huk \nPolitburo, the body that executed the decisions of the Huk \nCentral Committee. Then, one early morning, the MIS efforts \nwere amply rewarded. \nBefore dawn of October 18, 1950, twenty-two organized \nunits of the Armed Forces, aided by the Manila Police, raided \nseveral places simultaneously and caught the brains of the Pol¬ \nitburo: Atty. Jose Lava, member of the well-to-do and cultured \nLava Family of Bulakan, Bulakan; Federico Bautista; Simeon \nG. Rodriguez, a former newspaperman; Salome Cruz; Ramon \nEspiritu; Angel Baking; and others. Important Huk documents \nwere taken and used as evidence in court. The politburo mem¬ \nbers were charged with rebellion complexed with murder and \narson. The Manila Court of First Instance, then presided by \nJudge Oscar Castelo, sentenced them to life imprisonment. The \ncase led to a division in the legal circles, some lawyers believing \nthat there was no such thing as rebellion complexed with mur¬ \nder and arson, for the penal code does not mention such crime; \nothers, on the other hand, believed there was such a crime.

The \nback of the Huk movement was broken. \nThe Surrender of Tame .-With the election of Ramon Mag- \nsay say to the presidency in 1953, the Huk movement lost its \nglamour. President Magsaysay, an avowed lover of the “little \npeople,” toured the barrios, kissed children and old women, and \nheartily pumped the hands of the peasants. He continued his \npolicy of attraction, at the same time resorting to the mailed fist \npolicy in an attempt to break completely the Huk movement. \nEarly in 1954, President Magsaysay secretly appointed Be- \nnigno S. Aquiho, Jr., of the Daily Mirror, his personal emissary \nto Tame. After four months of negotiations, Tame, on May \n17, 1954, surrendered to the government. With security guards, \nhe was whisked to Manila wher£ he announced that he “un¬ \nreservedly recognized the authority of President Magsaysay and \nthe sovereignty of the Republic of the Philippines.” Tame was \nbrought to court and sentenced to serve twelve years in prison. \nTame’s unconditional surrender further demoralized the \nHuk movement.

Having its roots in the enconmienda system which was \ncharacterized by greed, brutality, and corruption, the Huk mass- \nmovement is the culmination of centuries of peasant degrada¬ \ntion, loss of self-respect, and abject poverty. What surprises a \nstudent ovf history or sociology is that the Huk movement did \nnot occur earlier, say, in the nineteenth century, when condi¬ \ntions were so degrading and corruption and greed so rampant \nthat it is a source of extreme wonder why the peasants did not \nthink of uniting as one. This is probably because the intellectuals \nwho could have led the movement were indifferent to the plight \nof the masses and interested themselves only in the affairs of \ntheir own class. With the coming of the Americans, however, \npolitical consciousness penetrated the rank and file leading, in \nthe final instance, to the rise of the poor but educated class \nwho led the masses in the struggle for “rice and fish.” Given \nadequate leadership, the masses began to think and feel, and the \nresulting “thinking and feeling” led to militancy. At this point, \nan alien ideology, communism, filtered through the charged \natmosphere and won over a segment of the masses whose \ndesperation led them to accept that which promised them heaven \non earth. The masses were like drowning men who would clutch \nat the straw to save themselves. \nIn the Huk and other agrarian movements, the government \nis as much to blame as the “naive” masses. True, the latter had \nbeen impatient, but this is so because they had waited for cen¬ \nturies for their redemption and received nothing but solid blows \nfrom the caciques who were close to the government. When the \nordinarily supine, docile, and law-abiding peasants finally found \nthe voice to utter their misery, their sufferings, and the injustices \ndone to them by the powerful, the government, through almost \nfour hundred years, failed or simply refused to heed that lonely \nvoice and instead used force to maintain the social and economic \nstatus quo. The peasants, the most abused and exploited class \nin Filipino society, may go down in defeat after defeat, but as \nlong as the government remains deaf to their pleas and \nremonstrances, as long as conditions remain the same as during \nthe Spanish times, just so long will there be agrarian unrest. \nWhen well-to-do and cultured men like Pedro Abad Santos and \nthe Lava brothers (Vicente, Jose, and Jesus), who had everything \nto lose and nothing to gain, cast their present and their future"

In these peace campaigns he found in his Secretary \nof National Defense, Ramon Magsaysay, an able and honest \nman who, with the President’s moral and financial backing, \nbrought about an official change of attitude toward the prob¬ \nlem of dissidence, Regarded as plain banditry compounded of \ncommunism, the Hukbalahap movement, which was in essence \nagrarian in nature, lost its glamour when Secretary Magsaysay \ncame to them with an open heart and convinced many of them \nthat their future lay in peace with honor. With the help of trained \npublic relations men, Magsaysay projected himself into the na¬ \ntional scene as the friend of the tao. In 1953, having been glamor¬ \nized at the expense of the President, he ran for the highest office \nof the land and was elected with a convincing majority. He \ntoured the barrios, gave an ear to the plaints of the common men, \npromised to uplift their condition, and built artesian wells and \nfeeder roads to the barrios. He was at the height of his popularity \nwhen he died in an accident. Vice-President Carlos P.

In all \ndifficult undertakings, as in the Spanish pacification campaigns \nand expeditions to foreign lands, in the American campaigns \nagainst the Muslims, and in the Filipino participation in World \nWar II, he has been a beast of burden.

Nobody \nhas seemed to think of him; the life he leads has been the life \nhis ancestors led. There has been, since the American occupation, \na little change in his earning capacity but his purchasing power \nhas remained the same, comparatively speaking, so that actually \nthere has been negligible change for the better in his way of life. \nFor almost four hundred years he had lived the life of the \ndumb beast of burden.

No one in \nthe government ever thought of honestly examining the causes \nof his discontent; it was enough that he took up arms against \nthose in power to condemn him as dissident, bandit, and highway \nrobber.

Properly exploited, the \nvote of the tao decided the election. Magsaysay became Presi¬ \ndent on the strength of the tao vote and the material help of the \nAmericans, who backed him up to the hilt. For the first time, \nthe tao realized his strength and importance in national politics. \nMagsaysay’s Charismatic Leadership .-“True to his promise, \nMagsaysay worked hard to make the tao a man in his community. \nHe geared his administration to the urgent demands of rural \nuplift. “To be really secure,” he ''aid, “a country must assure \nfor its citizens the social and economic conditions that would \nenable them to live in decency, free from ignorance, disease, \nand want.” Young, enthusiastic, and fired with a Messianic \nfervor, Magsaysay enlisted the help not only of the governmental \nagencies, but also of the civic organizations in the vast under¬ \ntaking of “bringing freedom and progress to our barrios.” Thus \nhe approached the rural problem along three lines: (1) the im¬ \nprovement of the land tenure system, with land resettlement \nthrown in for good measure; (2) easy-term credit to the peasants, \nthe building of roads and other facilities for the benefit of the \nrural folk, and giving technical advice to the farmers on how to \nimprove farm operations; and (3) an intensive community devel¬ \nopment with self-help as the basic factor. \nAs a first step toward the realization of these objectives, \nMagsaysay had Congress pass the Agricultural Tenancy Act in \n1954 which provides for greater protection to the tenants by \ngranting them the freedom to choose the system of tenancy \nunder which they would want to work. The implementation of \nthis Act was accomplished with the establishment of the Agri¬ \ncultural Tenancy Commission and the Court of Agrarian Re¬ \nlations whose main function is to settle satisfactorily and prompt¬ \nly all tenancy disputes. \nMagsaysay believed that an important measure in the land \nsystem was to purchase or expropriate large estates for distri \nbution to their occupants or to the landless. But this objective \nwas not implemented owing mainly to lack of funds. Neverthe¬ \nless, some public lands were distributed to qualified settlers."

Agricultu¬ \nral lots were distributed to landless applicants, which numbered \n18,824 in 1954 and 23,578 in 1955. Such statistics show how \nfast the agencies of the government worked under the charis¬ \nmatic leadership of Magsaysay and how the leader of the na¬ \ntion could do something tangible to relieve the peasant of his \nonerous burden. \nThis was not all, however. The National Resettlement and \nRehabilitation Administration (NARRA) resettled, in 1955, \nsome 8,800 families in twenty-two settlement projects. To en¬ \ncourage landless settlers in occupying and improving public \nlands, the government surve>ed some 401,425 hectare in 1955. \nSome of these settlements apparently are prospering, but ottiers, \nlike the Akle Settlement Project in Bulakan, are a complete \nfailure owing to the lack of government supervision and active \nhelp in promoting the welfare of the settlers. \nIn his desire to make the rural areas a part of the nation-] \ncommunity in which the hitherto ignorant and poverty-stricken \npeople could take active participation in community and national \nlife, Magsaysay thought of extending barrio roads and construct¬ \ning new ones in order to link the rural districts to the urban \ncenters. In 1954, some 252 kilometers of new roads were con¬ \nstructed; this number increased to 565 kilometers the following \nyear. Such an improvement had the effect of increasing the \nmobility of the- rural population and of making it easy for the \npeasant to market hi* products.

All his pians relative to the rural uplift, though im¬ \npressive to the peasants, were mere improvisations, patchwork, \na temporary expedient that meant continued alliance of the \nmasses with him. Offices were created here and there with \ngrandiose plans and promises, but many of these offices were \nnot given sufficient funds with which to carry out the policies \nof rural development to a successful conclusion. There was too \nmuch enthusiasm in laying down broad policies but less plan¬ \nning ahead. The esult was a superficial “development” of the \nbarrio, a development” that cannot be permanent owing to the \nfact that there was neither plan nor direction in the rural project. \nToday the tao is exactly where he was before Magsaysay. \nThe Election of 1957.- Magsaysay had prepared a ten-point \nprogram of administration designed to stabilize Filipino society \nwhen death overtook him in an airplane.

In the early \nmorning hours of March 17, his plane was reported missing. \nIt was late in the afternoon of the day when the newspapers \ncarried the news that the airplane had met with an accident \nand that all aboard, except one newspaperman, were killed. Vice \nPresident Carlos P. Garcia succeeded to the presidency to com¬ \nplete the last eight months of Magsaysay in office. \nNo significant changes were made by the new President in \nMagsaysay’s policies. There was, to be sure, much work to be \ndone, but elections were coming up in November and President \nGarcia had to prepare for his regular election. Including the \nPresident there were four candidates in all. One of Magsaysay’s \nboys ran on the same platform as his departed Chief and inde- \nfatigably toured the barrios to win the tao's vote. To make his \ncampaigns effective, this particular candidate had his picture \nretouched in such a manner as to resemble the late President.

The \nbelief was bom that as the Church goes so goes the election. \nIt was widely known, however, that many of the hierarchy were \nfor certain candidates and against some who in years past had \nthe courage to speak out against the meddling of the hierarchy \nin political matters. At any rate, the results of the election \nshowed that the so-called Catholic votes were not solid as at \nfirst thought by many. President Garcia was elected with a \ncomfortable majority, but his running mate, Speaker Jose Laurel \nJr., was defeated by his Liberal rival, Diosdado Macapagal. For \nthe first time in Philippine political history, a President was \nelected with a Vice President belonging to the rival party."

Appealing to \nthe people for cooperation in this urgent matter, he said: \nAusterity as a policy means temperate spending. It signifies \nmore work, more thrift, more productive investment and more \nefficiency. It means less imports and less extravagant consumption. \nIt is a challenge to our resiliency as a people to change our past \nhabits and make thrift and economy our everyday way of living. \nImposed on us by harsh realities, the exercise of austerity in our \neveryday life is a desirable end in itself. \nThis appeal, no doubt, was the result of a careful observa¬ \ntion of the apish habits of Filipinos who have so far shown their \npropensity to out-Spanish the Spaniard and out-American the \nAmerican. The development of such habits, perhaps unconscious¬ \nly encouraged particularly by the Americans in order to tie the \nFilipinos to American goods, has led to heavy importations of \nluxury goods which could not in any manner help in the economic \ndevelopment of the country. \nAside from austerity, President Garcia favored selective \ncontrols in order to lessen or “arrest the expansion of credit for \nnon-productive activities.” He expressed himself as opposed to \na “move for a return to free enterprise in Philippine economy” \nbecause it meant the “preservation of alien domination of the \nnational economy.” In brief, President Garcia’s objectives were: \n1. To complete Philippine economic independence through \nthe adoption of the Filipino First policy and similar measures; \n2. To establish Filipino dignity as a free people by dealing \nwith foreign powers on terms of sovereign equality; \n3. To achieve a balanced economy by providing equal impetus \nto agriculture and industry; \n4. To promote social justice and the general welfare of the \nmasses; and \n5. To minimize and, if possible, to eradicate graft and cor¬ \nruption. \nWith all his nationalistic policies, particularly in the economic \nfield, Garcia’s administration suffered, like those of his pre¬ \ndecessors, from graft and corruption.

The hoarding and black marketing \nof rice by unscrupulous merchants and the natural calamities \nthat affected rice production precisely at a time when the \npresidential election was at hand, infuriated the people. The \nearly counting of votes showed a definite trend for Macapagal, \nwho was catapulted to the presidency with a safe margin. \nMacapagal’s Program—Addressing the Congress on January \n22, 1962, Macapagal outlined the objectives of his socio-economic \nprogram as (1) immediate restoration of economic stability, \n(2) the alleviation of the common man’s plight, and (3) the \nestablishment of a “dynamic basis for future growth.” He also \ndelineated his administration’s mission by setting forth five \ngoals: \n(1) The solution of the problem of unemployment; \n(2) The attainment of self-sufficiency in the staple food of \nour people, namely, rice and com; \n(3) The creation of conditions that will provide more income \nto our people — income for those who have none and more \nincome for those whose earnings are inadequate for their \nelemental needs; \n(4) The establishment of practices that will strengthen the \nmoral fiber of our nation and reintroduce those values \nthat would invigorate our democracy and \n(5) The launching of a bold but well-formulated socio-economic \nprogram that shall place the country on the road to \nprosperity for all our people. \nRealizing that the people had lost their sense of morality, \nMacapagal, in the flush of victory, promised to strengthen the \nmoral fiber “through formal modes of reform” and in setting \nthe example of “honesty, uprightness and simple living.” The \nlast, simple living, caught the imagination of the people, who \neasily forgot Garcfa’s “austerity program”, and transformed it \ninto a gleaming slogan. But no sooner had Macapagal declared \nhimself the head of the crusaders for simple living than his com- \nprovincianos invited him and his lady to a flagrant example of \nwasteful living.

One of the \nmost important posts, that of Central Bank Governor, was given \nto former Secretary of Finance Dominador Aytona by outgoing \nPresident Garcia. Macapagal countered by appointing his own \nman, Andres Castillo, to the sensitive position. .

In ordering the immediate deportation of the two “by \nthe first available transportation from the Philippines,” President \nMacapagal stated that the presence of Stonehill and Brooks \nin the Philippines “constitute an immediate and continuing \nmenace to the peace, welfare and security of the country.” The \ndeportation order was severely criticized in many quarters, and \nSenator Arturo M.

There was, there¬ \nfore, keen disappointment in the nationalist ranks when Maca¬ \npagal was elected president. Six months after his election, how¬ \never, Macapagal surprised the nationalist camp with his Executive \nOrder shifting Philippine Independence Day from the traditional \nJuly 4 to June 12, the day when, in 1898, the Declaration of \nIndependence was read at Kawit, Cavite. The shift did not escape \nthe critical eye of some Americans and their sympathizers, and \nthey accused Macapagal of shifting the date of the celebration \nof Independence Day to June 12 not because he was convinced \nof the latter’s logic, but because the American House of Repre¬ \nsentatives did not approve the $73-million Philippine war damage \nbill. To the nationalists, Macapagal’s sudden move, whatever his \nmotives, was a pleasant surprise, for in their book Macapagal \ndid not act as he was expected to - namely, to play the role of \nthe tail to the American Lite. Since 1962, therefore, the Philip¬ \npines has been celebrating Independence Day on June 12.

The \nsituation was desperate and desperate situations call tor des¬ \nperate measures. Statistics show that 78.4% of the people earn \nless than P2,000 a year and 17.1% earn less than P5,000. Of \nthe labor force of about 11.2 million, only b.2 million were, \nand still are, employed. When one considers tnat the bulk of \nthe labor force is in the rural area, that is to say, 6.4 million \nare found in agricultural areas and only 4.5 million in the non- \nagricultural areas, then the rural situation could not help crying \nfor a radical change.

It was obvious from the beginning that the Land Reform \nCode would have a rough sailing in both chambers of Congress, \nfor landlord influence was and still is a pervading force in the \ncountry. After stormy debates which resulted in the emascula¬ \ntion of the original bill, Congress passed it and became Republic \nAct No. 3844 on August 8, 1963, when Macapagal signed it into \nlaw. \nThe Land Reform Code delineates the policy of the State \nas follows: \n1. To establish owner-cultivatorship and the economic family- \nsize farm as the basis of Philippine agriculture and, as a consequence, \ndivert landlord capital in agriculture to industrial development; \n2. To achieve a dignified existence for the small farmers free \nfrom pernicious institutional restraints and practices; \n3. To create a truly viable social and economic structure in \nagriculture conducive to greater productivity and higher farm \nincomes; \n4. To apply all labor laws equally and without discrimination \nto both industrial and agricultural wage earners; \n5. To provide a more vigorous and systemat;c land resettlement \nprogram and public land distribution; and \n6. To make the small farmers more independent, self-reliant and \nresponsible citizens, and a source of genuine strength in our demo¬ \ncratic society. \nUnder the Code, the share tenancy system in agriculture, \nwhich has been one of the primary causes of peasant poverty \nand discontent since Spanish Colonial times, is to be replaced \nby the agricultural leasehold system. Macapagal declared twelve \ntowns in Central Luzon as land reform areas where the experi¬ \nment in leasehold system would be conducted. Under the Code, \nthe former tenant would enter into a contract with his former \nlandlord in which the leaseholder, who would be given a loan \nby the government, would pay 25 per cent of the harvest to the \nlandowner. Theoretically, the leaseholder, under such a system, \nwould be freed from the clutches of the landlord. \nThe significance of the land reform code may be viewed \nagainst the dark background of Philippine agriculture.

In terms of territory, three provinces have a tenancy \nrate of 60% or more; seven have more than 50; seven have more \nthan 40; eleven have more than 30; ten have more than 20; and \nton have less than 20. Tenancy is heavily concentrated in Central \nLuzon, and this partially accounts for the presence of so-called \ndissidents in that region and for the organization of aggressive \npeasant unions which culminated in the armed rebellion of the \nHukbalahaps in the late 1940’s and the early 1950’s. \nInitial Results.- -Despite dire predictions of some critics of \nthe land reform program, the initial results of Macapagal’s ef¬ \nforts are encouraging. In Plaridel, Bulakan, which Macapagal \nproclaimed as the first land reform area, the leaseholders have \nimproved their living conditions. Said the Manila Times: “The \noverwhelming bulk of Plaridel respondents in a Robot-Gallup \nsurvey showed that land reform in their view had materially \nimproved local living conditions.” Reports of similar success \nin other places declared land reform areas have been made. \nWhether this attempt to abolish the age-old evils of tenancy \nwill succeed depends on several factors, not the least of which \nare financing, the sincerity and seriousness of the succeeding \nadministrations in implementing the law, the willingness of the \nlandlords to accommodate the leaseholders, the ability of the \npeasants themselves to work hard and to do away with their \ntraditional behavior of subservience, fanaticism, and lack of \ninitiative. \nPresident Marcos, realizing the social and economic impli¬ \ncations of the land reform program, promised in his State-of- \nthe-Nation message in January 1966 that he would implement \nthe law. The land reform projects in 1966 totaled 29,000 hec¬ \ntares, an insignificant number compared with 940,591 hectares \nbeing worked by 420,000 palay and com share-tenants. The \nLand Bank provided for by the Land Reform Code to finance \nthe program is, so far, good only on paper. It has no money. \nIn 1966, Marcos ordered the sale of six government properties \nin order to raise something like P50,000,000 to start the Land \nBank.

This explains the high degree of criminality during \nan election year: the political leaders and followers of candidates, \nwhether for national or local positions, stake their lives on their \ncandidates not because they love the poltticos, but because their \nfuture economic stability depends on the victory of th<ir candi¬ \ndates. \nAs in the presidential election of 1957, the Catholic hier¬ \narchy and the indigenous Iglesia ni Kristo (Church of Chi is t) \nwere dragged into the political cesspool. The latter was accused \nof openly supporting Marcos and other national and local can¬ \ndidates, which was in violation of the Constitution which pro¬ \nhibits any church from interfering with the affairs of th? State. \nOn the other hand, the rabid Catholics were sharply divided \ninto two camps: one supporting Macapagal and the other support¬ \ning Manglapus. The confusion in the Catholic sector was com¬ \npounded when Rufino Cardinal Santos, then in Rome issued a \nstatement advising the faithful “to vote for the sure winner.’ Many \nconstrued “the sure winner” to mean Macapagal not only be¬ \ncause he as r\\ power, but also because the Catholic lay leader \nwho flew to Rome to get the statement from the Cardinal was \nidentified with Macapagal.

It was \nclear from the trend of the voting that the people, as in 1961, \nwanted a change in the hope that a new administration would \nrelieve them of their fears. Marcos won by a big majority.

The daily \nincome of the government was P4 million, while its expenditure \nwas P6 million, the cash daily deficit of a cool P2 million. At the \nend of 1965, the cash position of the government stood at minus \nP228 million. The government-owned bank itself, the Philippine \nNational Bank, was nearly bankrupt: its unpaid loans to govern¬ \nment corporations amounted to more than P400 million, while \nthe Development Bank of the Philippines, which usually earned \nmillions in profits, lost more than P5 million in 1965. The inci¬ \ndence of crimes, on the other hand, was on the upsurge. “The \ncrime clock,” Marcos admitted candidly, “indicates murder and \nhomicide every hour, theft every 30 minutes, robbery every hour, \nsexual offenses, estafa and falsification every two hours.” Pend¬ \ning cases in courts numbered 80,000. Such an ugly picture of \nthe country’s social and economic conditions made Marcos’ posi¬ \ntion unenviable. \nFacing the serious problems squarely, Marcos outlined his \nobjectives: \n1. Self-sufficiency in the production of rice and the diversifica¬ \ntion of crops; \n2. Implementation of the land reform program; and \n3. Intensification of the community development program \nin order to “strengthen further our social, economic and political \nbase.” \nTo attain these objectives, Marcos proposed the enactment"

In brief, the main arguments of the “antis” were based \non the following: (1) the Constitution renounces war as an instru¬ \nment of national policy, and so the sending of a military con¬ \ntingent to South Vietnam was tantamount to an act of war; (2) \nthe country was, and is still, too poor to waste P35,000,000 a \nyear to support the battalion to be sent to South Vietnam; (3) \nthe money could be better spent in constructing irrigation systems \nto increase the rice yield and in constructing school houses and \nroads; (4) the war in South Vietnam was, and is still, an American \nwar and that the Philippines had and has, no business meddling \nin the internal affairs of another country; and (5) the United \nStates wanted the Philippines to join the war in order to show \nthe world that the war in Vietnam was and still is not a racial \nwar (the white American waging a relentless war against the \ncolored Vietnam people), but a war for the preservation of \ndemocracy in Southeast Asia; hence the entry of the Philippines \nm the war. The “pros” had only one argument, namely, that \nthe Philippines should help extinguish the communist fire in a \nneighboring country before it reached the Philippines. \nThe newspapers and magazines called the pros “Hawks” \nand the antis “Doves.” Marcos knew the persuasive powers \nof his office and used them to advantage. He conferred with \nthe “Doves” who instantly became “Hawks.” The public ex¬ \npectation that the “Doves” in the Senate would have their way \nbecame an illusion: with few exceptions,4 the “Doves” suddenly \nbecame “Hawks.” On July 14, 1966, Marcos signed the bill \ninto law. The Philippines is now a participant in Johnson’s \nVietnam “war.” \nDeterioration of Peace and Order.—The condition of peace \nand order which all previous administrations failed to solve \nsatisfactorily worsened during the first two years of the Marcos \nadministration.

The joint communique \nwas a resume of the discussions — minus the arrogant words \nof Johnson -- of the seven nations, with emphasis on conditions \nin South Vietnam, economic stability and progress, political \nevolution, the search for peace, cessation of aggression, and \ncontinuing consultation among the participating nations. The \ndeclaration on peace and progress may be described as ideals \ndevoutly to be wished: namely, “(1) aggression must not succeed; \n(2) we must break the bonds of poverty, illiteracy, arid disease; \n(3) we must strengthen economic, social, and cultural cooperation \nwithin the Asian and Pacific region; and (4) we must seek recon¬ \nciliation and peace throughout Asia.” The third document, \n“The Goals of Freedom,” contained a commitment “1. to be \nfree from aggression; 2. to conquer hunger, illiteracy and diseases; \n3. to build a region of security, order, and progress; 4. to seek \nreconciliation and peace throughout Asia and the Pacific.” Those \n“goals” are, clearly, a repetition of the second document. But \nthis conspectus of ideals, though desirable, can only be achieved \nthrough hard work, self-reliance, honesty, and integrity of the \nrulers and peoples of Asia. No amount of money poured by the \nUnited States into any underdeveloped Asian nation can make \nit progressive, if those who rule are corrupt, inept, unprincipled, \nopportunistic, and greedy. The habit of mendicancy can never \nlead to economic progress. Unless the peoples of Asia help them¬ \nselves and revise their traditional habits and institutions which \nare inimical to progress, they will forever remain menials in their \nown countries. Unless these conditions are met, the “Manila \nSummit” of 1966 will go down in history as a mere social gather¬ \ning of like-minded nations of Asia whose opinions were shape \nfor them by the President of the United States. \nIn justice to President Marcos, it must be said that he tried \nhis best to tone drwn the warlike posture of the first draft of \nthe communique and succeeded in inserting a phrase in section 3, \n8Napoleon G.

The intelligence agencies, instead of investigating \nthe police and the student demonstrations, immediately labelled \nthe latter and their leaders, particularly the nationalistic Kaba- \ntaang Makabayan, as communists. Three committees of Con¬ \ngress summoned some student leaders allegedly to investigate \npolice brutality, but the investigations turned out to be nothing \nmore than witch-hunting and name-calling. The students who \nappeared in good faith at the Congressional hearings were shouted \nat, insulted, bamboozled, and accused of being subversives by \nsome over-enthusiastic and narrow-minded congressmen. The \nNational Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA), the highest \nintelligence agency in the country, utilized the services of dis¬ \ncredited professional anti-communists to libel the student de¬ \nmonstrators and some thirty or forty university professors, most \nof whom were from the U.

Consequently, they believed that it was the \nbrusque and anti-nationalist congressmen, the intelligence agencies \nand their professional witnesses who should be investigated for \nserving allegedly alien interests, particularly, it was alleged, their \nlinks with the notorious CIA. \nWhen the intelligence agencies and their paid witnesses, \nwho, as Filipinos, are supposed to uphold and protect the na¬ \ntional interest*! above those of any other country and who are \nexpected to respect the civil liberties of the people, make un¬ \nfounded and unproved accusations which cannot stand in court, \nand when they resort to character assassination through trial \nby publicity, then, Filipino society has indeed returned to the \nDark Ages when burning at the stakes of alleged witches was \nthe rule.

In such circumstances the leaders of the nation could \nonly rely on the United States for financial and other material \naid. The hundreds of millions of dollars given to the Philip¬ \npines by the United States in the form of cash and surplus \nproperty were used to rehabilitate agriculture, commerce, trade, \nand industry. Some of it, however, went to the pockets of dis¬ \nhonest officials. There were marked increases in the gross national \noutput and income, but the cost of living, as a whole, continues \nto soar or, at least, to remain static on the basis of the im¬ \nmediate post-liberation years. At the same time, labor grew and \ncontinues to grow, demanding increases in wages and better \nliving conditions.

With financial help from the United \nStates, however, the government, in the first ten years of the \nRepublic, had succeeded in at least partially solving the minor \neconomic problems. Thus, for instance, crop production from \n1946 to 1956 increased from 3,507,200 metric tons to almost \ndouble the amount of 6,274,900 metric tons. This increased \nproduction was the upshot of the expanded area planted to food \ncrops and the application of improved means of increasing the \nyield per hectare, such as the use of fertilizer, irrigation, the \nuse of better seeds, and the effective use of chemicals against \nplant pests and diseases. Production of export crops also in¬ \ncreased tremendously from 315,500 metric tons in 1946 to \n2,770,000 in 1956, with copra and sugar leading all export crops. \nOther export crops like abaca, tobacco and their by-products \nhave not so far completely recovered from the effects of the last \nwar. \nIn other sectors of the agricultural economy there has been \npartial recovery.

The livestock population, which \nnumbered 3,596,200 in 1946, increased to 10,297,600 in 1956, \nand that of poultry from 7,516,000 to 49,632,600 in the same \nperiod. \nThe post-war demands of rehabilitation and reconstruction \nalso led to increased activity in the lumber and timber industry. \nIn 1946 timber and lumber production amounted to only 91 \nmillion board feet and 29 million board feet, respectively. These \nnumbers soared in 1964 to 2,530,582,711 board feet of pro¬ \nduction was the outcome of local and foreign demands, thus \nmaking the timber and lumber industry the third biggest industry \nin the Philippines today. \nDomestic Trade. -Added to the grave economic problems \nresulting from the war, the economy also suffered from alien \ncontrol of the domestic trade* It was to lessen this alien hold on \ndomestic trade that the government passed remedial measures. \nThese measures, known as nationalization laws, included the \nMarket Stalls Act (1946), which provides that citizens of the \nPhilippines “shall have preference in the lease of public market \nstalls”; the Retail Trade Nationalization Law (1954), which \nprovides that no person, partnership, association, or capital \nwhich is not wholly owned by Filipino citizens shall engage in \nthe retail trade; the Filipino Retailers’ Fund Act (1955), which \nprovides that credit facilities be extended to Filipino retailers; \nthe NAMARCO Act (1955), which provides for the establish¬ \nment of the National Marketing Corporation (NAMARCO), a \ngovernment corporation charged with assisting Filipino retailers \nand busmessmen by supplying them with goods at prices that \nwould enable them to compete in the open market. These laws, \nand scores of other nationalization laws dealing with natural \nresources, public utilities, trade, commerce, and industry, are \nmeant to loosen the stranglehold of aliens in domestic trade. \nThe Philippines is probably the only country where foreigners \nenjoy a great advantage in business matters over the Filipinos. \nWith the passage of the various nationalization laws, the opening \nof new roads, the improvements in public utilities, and the ex¬ \ntension of credit facilities to Filipino retailers and merchants, \ndomestic trade is gradually placed in the hands of Filipinos."

This characteristic is best reflect¬ \ned in the unfavorable balance of trade during the ten-year period \nfrom 1946 to 1955, which amounted to P2,877,531,744. The \nhighest imbalance in foreign trade was recorded in 1949 when \nthe unfavorable balance amounted to P625,686,000. This alarm¬ \ning spectacle led the government to institute radical reforms to \narrest or at least lessen the unfavorable impact of trade imbalances \non the national economy. One of the most important of these \nreforms was the system of import and exchange controls which \nbecame operative in 1949 or 195C. The imbalance registered \ndaring the ten-year period, 1946-1955, was accompanied by the \nfalling prices of major export crops such as abaca, sugar, and \ncopra. The total foreign trade of the Philippines during the period \nunder study amounted to P15,732,488,123, of which about \n70% constituted trade with the United States. \nMineral Production.- The extensive mineral wealth of the \ncountry has not been fully exploited owing principally to the \nlack of sufficient Filipino capital. This mineral wealth can be \ngleaned from the report of the Bureau of Mines in 1956: \n15 million tons of gold and silver reserves worth P250,000,000; \n1.2 billion tons of iron ores worth PI 2,000,000,000, \n22 million tons of copper worth P320,000,000; \n10 million tons of chrome ores worth P270,000,000; \n0.2 million tons of manganese worth PI2,000,000; \n12 million tons of coal worth P180,000,000; and \n60 million tons of other minerals and non-metals worth P738,000,-000. \nProduction from 1946 to 1956 showed great improvements. In \n1946, owing mainly to the destruction of machinery and mining \ntools, the total mineral production, which included gold, silver, \nbase metal and non-metals, was valued at P3,997,035.

In desperation, President Quirino requested Pres¬ \nident Harry S. Truman to send an economic survey team ui \nthe Philippines to study ways and means of, first, discovering \nthe ills of the Philippine economy, and second, submitting re¬ \ncommendations to solve those problems. Consequently, Pres¬ \nident Truman appointed Daniel W. Bell1 in 1950 to head the \nUnited States Economic Survey Mission with instructions to \n“survey all aspects of the Philippine economy, including agri¬ \nculture, industry, internal and external finances, domestic and \nforeign trade, and public administration.” The Bell Mission \nwas further instructed to take into special account the immediate \nmeasures to be taken in order to “help raise production and \nliving standards in the Philippines.” \nFor several months the Bell Mission, with the cooperation \nof the Philippine Government and its agencies, surveyed the \neconomic conditions of the country and made the following \nconclusions:2 \n1. The basic economic problem in the Philippines is inef¬ \nficient production and very low incomes. \n2. The finances of the Government had become steadily \nworse and were not critical. The Treasury had a large and mount¬ \ning deficit, with taxes covering little more than 60% of the ex¬ \npenditures. \n3. The country had had an excessive volume of imports. \nIn the meantime, the volume of exports was less than before the \nwar and could be expected to grow only gradually. \nThe Bell Report summed up the causes of these economic \ndifficulties as follows: \n1.

Some of these were the \nestablishment of rural banks, the passage of the Magna Carta \nof Labor and other labor laws, the encouragement of new and \nnecessary industries, the institution of the system of import \nand exchange controls and the reorganization of the govern¬ \nment and the reclassification of employees and officials. \nFinancial Institutions .“-The financial position of the coun¬ \ntry before 1950 was so serious that economists and financial \nexperts advocated the establishment of a Central Bank to en¬ \nsure the economic progress and financial stability of the nation \nand to provide a firm basis for political sovereignty. It took \nsometime for the government to appreciate the wisdom of such \na step, for it was not until 1948 that a bill providing for the \ncreation of the Central Bank was passed by Congress and sign¬ \ned by President Quirino. The Central Bank was inaugurated \non January 3, 1949 and was immediately hailed as the Charter \nof Philippine economic sovereignty. Primarily, the function of \nthe Central Bank is to maintain the stability of the peso. To \ndischarge this primary function, the Central Bank was given \nthe powers to preserve the international value of the peso and \nits convertibility into other free currencies and to promote the \nrising level of production, employment, and real income in the \nPhilippines. To attain these ends, the Bank was granted the \nmonopoly of issuing currency. At the same time, it acts as \nfinancial adviser to the government. It regulates the banking \nsystem through effective supervision of all banking institutions \nin the country, their operations, and other matters necessary \nto stabilize the peso. The most powerful financial institution \nin the country, the Central Bank controlled dollar allocations \nfor imports and collected the 25% marginal fee on all imports. \nThe necessity of rehabilitating and developing industries, \nagriculture, and buildings led President Manuel Roxas to re-"

The bill creating the corporation was pass¬ \ned in 1946, but it began operations on January 2, 1947 with \nan authorized capital of P300,000,000. It is charged by the law \n“to provide credit facilities for the rehabilitation of agriculture, \ncommerce and industry, the reconstruction of property damaged \nby the war, and the broadening and diversification of the na¬ \ntional economy.” The RFC, therefore, had two objectives: to \nrepair the damage resulting from World War II and to under¬ \ntake activities designed to promote the economic well-being of \nthe country. To attain the first objective, the RFC granted \nloans for the building of new factories or for the reconstruction \nof old ones, for the purchase of equipments and implements \nto replace those destroyed during the war, for the reconstruc¬ \ntion of damaged commercial buildings, and for the building of \nnew houses. The reconstruction program of the RFC, on the \nother hand, included the extension of financial assistance to pri¬ \nvate banks, insurance companies, and building and loan asso¬ \nciations. \nAs a result of these activities, the RFC had succeeded in \nputting on their feet commercial and financial houses, indus¬ \ntries, agriculture, and building contractors.

However, there are indications that the state of \nthe nation will, with more efficiency and less graft and corrup¬ \ntion, improve and thus make life less exasperating. \nUnfavorable Features of the Economy.-The comparative \nrise in gross national output and national income and the ex¬ \npansion of trade and commerce fot the last ten years do not \nnecessarily mean the healthy growth of Filipino economy. For \nwhile the gross national output and national income may reflect \ngrowth, this growth, nevertheless, is not necessarily Filipino \ngrowth. The Census of 1948 shows that the total foreign as¬ \nsets of the country, while Filipinos owned 51.9% of the total \nassets. This means that the total assets were — and continue to \nbe *- almost equally divided between Filipinos and foreigners, \ncertainly not a flattering situation in a country where Filipinos \naie supposed to control the economy. The following table clearly \nillustrates the point: \nPHILIPPINES: FOREIGN COUNTRIES: \nTransportation \n76.1% \n23.9% \nForestry \n51.9% \n42.3% \nMining \n42.4% \n57.6% \nElectricity \n17.8% \n82.2% \nFisheries \n100 % \n— — \nCommerce \n' 46.1% \n53.9% \nManufacturing \n49.1% \n50.9% \nIt is obvious that the aliens control mining, electricity, com¬ \nmerce, and manufacturing, while Filipinos have a complete control \nof fisheries and a better control of forestry and transportation. \nThe statistics show that a large portion of the total assets of the \ncountry is in the hands of aliens who have the power, because \nof their wealth, to influence or even to control the political \nand economic policies of the country. In the import trade, \nFilipino participation is very much less than that of the foreigners \nbecause the former’s capital is very much less than that of the \nlatter.

Consequently, the aliens in the Philippines enjoy, surrepti¬ \ntiously, a political power that poses a danger to the political \nindependence of the country. \nEconomic Nationalism.- The predominant role of aliens in \nPhilippine economy and their growing influence in the political \nsphere met with opposition from, at first, a small sector of the \nintellectuals and Filipino businessmen under the leadership of \nSenator Claro M. Recto. The latter’s assaults on the then popular \ntheory of foreign investments in the Philippines in order to im¬ \nprove the national economy were looked upon with suspicion \nnot only by foreign investors and their dummies among the \nFilipinos, but also by President Magsaysay himself who was too \npolite to American powerful figures to oppose their impositions \non the Filipinos. At first a voice in the wilderness, Senator Recto \nwas joined by Carlos P. Garcia when the latter was catapulted \nto the Presidency in 1957. Garcia’s administration heralded \nthe resurgence of Filipino nationalism. The realization that \neven the Central Bank discriminated against Filipino businessmen \nin the allocation of dollars for imports and the fact that about \n70% of the domestic trade and about 80% of the foreign trade \nare in the hands of aliens, principally Chinese and Americans, \nled the Garcia Administration to enunciate officially the “Filipino \nFirst” policy. This was contained in Resolution No. 204 adopted \nby the National Economic Council (NEC) on August 21, 1958. \nHenceforth, Filipinos would be given preference in all matters \npertaining to the economic development of the country. \nThe political impact of the “Filipino First” policy was tre¬ \nmendous. The Nacionalista Party made political issue of it and \nits candidates toured the barrios to explain its meaning and sig¬ \nnificance. The policy caught fire especially among the Filipino \nbusinessmen and the intellectuals, and the Philippine Chamber \nof Commerce promptly adopted it as a slogan. The result of \nsuch a policy can be gleaned from the fact that Filipino partic¬ \nipation in dollar allocation as of December 1959 jumped to \n51%, meaning that Filipino businessmen might, in the near future, \ncapture the domestic and foreign trade from the powerful aliens. \nIf continued unabated, the “Filipino First” policy may yet lead \nto genuine industrialization, to more employment, and to the \ncapture of the national economy by Filipinos.

They saw in the \n“Filipino First” policy the eventual liquidation of their dominant \nrole as economic czars of the country which has been so tolerant \nof even the most unscrupulous and ruthless among the foreigners. \nBut President Garcia, on December 27, 1959, dismissed the \ncalculated rumor when he emphasized that the “Filipino First” \npolicy was not in any way directed against any alien but was \n“a struggle for the natural right of the Filipino people to be \nsupreme in their own country.’ \nThe economic awakening, particularly in the Filipinos’ in¬ \nsistence on nationalizing the retail trade, which took effect in \n1964, led to American cries of anti-Americanism and to pressures \non the government to amend the law in such a way as to give \nAmerican businessmen in the Philippines a decided advantage \neven over Filipino entrepreneurs. The American Chamber of \nCommerce, in particular, declared in September 1964 that “The \ndrive behind the nationalization legislation during the past decade \nand more is the natural desire of the Filipinos to play a dominant \npart in the conduct of their industry and trade of the country - \nwhen it is not merely the aim, no doubt, it is of a few, to enrich \nthemselves by stealing from others.” The statement drew the \nire of Filipino nationalists, and Senator Lorenzo Tanada, one of \nthe foremost nationalists and considered the successor of the late \nSenator Claro M. Recto, denounced the American attitude in a \nprivileged speech on the floor of the Senate. Said the senator: \nAre these the words of friends that Americans are supposed \nto be? They recognize, or claim they do, the basic merit of the \nnationalization movement. Yet they snipe as it — they would place \nthe entire movement under suspicion as “the aim of a few to enrich \nthemselves by stealing from others.” They sneer at it as blind \nnationalism, proof of an inferiority complex. They take potshots \nat our Supreme Court, which courageously upheld nationalistic \nlegislation as a legitimate exercise of the police power of the state, \nat Congress and the executive arm of our government. \nThe crusade for Filipino dominance in the economic field \nis on, but it will take a truly nationalistic government adminis¬ \ntration to free the country from alien control. \nThe Courts on the Retail Trade and “Parity.”- The desire \nof the Filipino economic nationalists to expand their oppor-"

The Retail Trade Nationalization \nAct (Republic Act No. 1180) was passed in 1954 and was to \ntake effect ten years later, on June 18, 1964, in order to give \nthe foreign business establishments enough time to make cer¬ \ntain adjustments. The law provides that only Filipino corpora¬ \ntions, associations, and partnerships wholly owned by Filipinos \ncan engage in retail trade. This was challenged by the Amer¬ \nicans who anchored their arguments on the so-called “parity” \nrights and, especially, in the Laurel-Langley Agreement of 1956, \nwhich extends American rights in the Philippines not only to \nthe exploitation of the natural resources of the Philippines and \nits transportation business, but also to all economic activities. \nThe Filipino nationalists challenged the validity and morality \nof the American contention that the Laurel-Langley Agreement \nand “parity” give the American corporations, partnerships, and \nassociations more rights than the Filipinos in the latter’s coun¬ \ntry, in that those American business establishments, even if \nnot who'ly owned and controlled by American citizens, can en¬ \ngage in retail trade. The Macapagal Administration, speaking \nthrough its Solicitor General who distinguished himself by be¬ \ning frequently defeated in the courts of law, maintained that \nthe Philippines had committed herself to the policy of exempt¬ \ning American business firms from the operation of the Retail \nTrade Nationalization Law. In view of the opposing views on \nthe matter, the Philippine Packing Corporation and other Amer¬ \nican firms went to court to get a judgment. \nOn December 16, 1966, Judge Hilarion Jarencio of the Court \nof First Instance of Manila ruled that the Americans and their \nbusiness enterprises “are prohibited by the Retail Trade National¬ \nization Law from engaging in retail business.” He cited that law’s \ndefinition of “retail trade”, which includes “sales in limited \nquantities to the general public of consumer goods for personal \nor household consumption, but also sales for industrial or com¬ \nmercial consumption.” Said Judge Jarencio: \nIt does not mean that the Philippines had renounced its in¬ \nherent right as a sovereign state to enact laws and adopt ordinances \nand regulations for the sole protection of Filipino citizens, and \nwhen it does so, such a law will automatically operate in favor"

Their \nfear was compounded when, the following day, December 17, \nthe Supreme Court, speaking through Justice Jesus G. Barrera, \nwhose decision on the “parity clause” was concurred in by all \nthe Justices, including Chief Justice Roberto Concepcion, de¬ \nfined the limits of “parity” tha* was imposed on the Philippines \nimmediately after World War II in exchange for rehabilitation \ndollars. The case arose when the San Jose Petroleum, Inc., a \nPanamanian company doing business in the Philippines, claimed \nto be American owned in order to enjoy the fruits of “parity” \nrights. The Supreme Court ruled that “a business enterprise, \nto be entitled to parity rights in the Philippines, must be owned \nand controlled by American citizens whose states give reciprocal \nrights to Filipinos.” Justice Barrera anchored his decision on \nthe fact that the so-called American petroleum company was \nnot 100% owned and controlled by American citizens, but by \ntwo foreign corporations. Justice Barrera himself admitted \nthat the significance of the Supreme Court’s decision lies in the \nfact that “in the enjoyment of parity rights, Americans cannot \nhave more rights than Filipinos.” \nThe economic effects of these court rulings on the Philip¬ \npine economy will be determined by later events, especially by \nthe reaction of the American Government which will naturally \nprotect the business interests of its citizens and will do every¬ \nthing in its power to make such protection effective. The im¬ \nmediate effect of the Jarencio ruling was that the American \nbusiness enterprises, led by the ESSO, fearing that the Supreme \nCourt might sustain Judge Jarencio’s decision, tried to effect \na compromise by appealing to President Marcos for 11 ■? latter \nto intervene in the matter. When Marcos did not intervene, \nthe Philippine Packing Corporation appealed the decision to the \nSupreme Court, which has not yet (1969) rendered a decision."

A \nfew voices, mostly coming from Filipino serfs who have not yet \nforgotten the sound of the chains of colonialism, are so pessi¬ \nmistic as to predict an economic dislocation if the Jarencio \ndecision became effective and implemented. However, Manila’s \nMayor Antonio J.

Under the decree, \nAmerican citizens or corporations owning lands in the Philippines \nacquired from private individuals are covered by the extension \ngranted by the decree, but landholdings acquired from the Philip¬ \npine Government must be disposed of at once. \nThe Growth of Labor Unions.-The growth of labor unions \nin the Philippines is essentially an upshot of the American oc¬ \ncupation. Labor unions were unknown during the Spanish per¬ \niod, for aside from the Jimited industrial and commercial op¬ \nportunities the Colonial Government did not encourage any \nmovement that would tend to undermine the Spanish view of \npeace and order. .On February 2, 1902, however, mainly owing \nto the American influence and to the free access of the Filipinos \nto books and periodicals carrying items about labor movements \nin the United States and elsewhere, a group of radical and pro¬ \ngressive Filipinos, led by Isabelo de los Reyes, Dominador Go¬ \nmez, Aurelio Tolentino, Hermenegildo Cruz, Lope K. Santos \nand others, founded the first labor union in the Philippines, the \nUnion Obrera Democratica de Filipinos. (Democratic Labor \nUnion of the Philippines). With La Redencion del Obrero as \nits official organ, the Union voiced the social demands and na¬ \ntionalistic feelings of the workers, for the labor unions of the \nperiod were the projection of the nationalistic era of the Re¬ \nvolution. Writers, who found in literature an ideal medium for \ncommunicating their nationalistic and socialistic tendencies, \nwrote essays, poems, and novels depicting the social conditions, \nthe aspirations of the masses, and what they believed to be the \nideal state. Most influential of these works, however, was \nLope K. Santos’ Banaag at Sikat. Avidly read by the masses \nand the intellectuals, the book in no small measure influenced \nthe workers in fighting for economic, social and political re¬ \nforms. As a result, more and more labor unions sprouted; \nstrikes were resorted to by the laborers, particularly those en¬ \ngaged in cigar and cigarette manufacture, to the discomfiture \nof the capitalists who had been accustomed to pushing the work¬ \ners around. The labor leaders, on May 1, 1913, presented a \nunited front when they held the first labor congress on the \noccasion of the celebration of the first labor day in the Philip¬ \npines."

Paguia and Ruperto S. \nCristobal opposed the communist-inspired tactics of Crisanto \nEvangelista, Jacinto Manahan, Antonio D.

When, in 1939, Secretary \nof Labor Jose Avelino formed the National Commission on La¬ \nbor, both the communist and conservative factions of labor \nwere represented. The conflict between the two labor camps \ncontinued up to the outbreak of the war, when all labor unions \nwere declared illegal by the Japanese conquerors. \nAfter the v.ar, the growth of labor was phenomenal. The \nlabor movement became dynamic, particularly because cf the \nwar experiences of the masses and of the influence of the Amer¬ \nican soldiers who were members of powerful labor unions in \nthe United States. Of the numerous labor unions that sprang \nup immediately after the war, the most popular and powerful \nwas the Commhtee (later changed to Congress) of Labor Or¬ \nganization (CLO), founded and dominated by progressive la¬ \nbor leaders. Laborers in all sectors of the economy were or¬ \nganized and strikes were used frequently to boost wages. At \nfirst headed by Cipriano Cid, a lawyer and former staff mem¬ \nber of the Manila Daily Bulletin, the union became aggressive \nunder the leadersnip of Amado V. Hernandez, former councilor \nof Manila, former editor of the daily Mabuhay and an eminent \nwriter and poet in Tagalog. With the labor front in turmoil \nowing to the uncompromising stand of the CLO and with Cen¬ \ntral Luzon up in arms against the government, Quirino’s admin¬ \nistration, taking advantage of the suspension of the writ of habeas \ncorpus, bore down on militant labor unions, particularly the \nCLO, and “invited” its leader to Camp Murphy for investigation. \nHernandez was detained for six montus before charges were \npreferred against him. He was charged with the crime of “re¬ \nbellion complexed with murder and arson” and sentenced to \nlife imprisonment.

A special tribunal, the Court of Industrial \nRelations, has been established to facilitate the settlement of \ndisputes between labor and management and to help in the \neffective implementation of laws governing the relationship \nbetween capital and labor, such as the Eight Hour Labor Law, \nthe Social Security Act, and others. \nThe most significant labor legislation safeguarding the rights \nof labor is Republic Act No. 875, popularly known as the Magna \nCarta of Labor. This law encourages laborers freely to form \nunions and recognizes the right of labor to bargain collectively \nand to declare strikes. There are, however, safeguards against \npossible abuse of power by the labor unions. Under the Magna \nCarta of Labor, a union could be guilty of unfair labor practices \nif it intimidates or prevents laborers from joining unions of their \nchoice, or if the union refuses to bargain collectively despite \nthe fact that it represents the majority of the workers, or if it \ndemands from employers payment to laborers for work not \ndone. \nThe Social Security Act of 1954 is another milestone in the \nhistory of Philippine labor. Under the Act, a social security \nfund is set up to be administered by the Social Security Com¬ \nmission. The fund consists of contributions from employers \nand laborers: 2.5% of the salaries to be contributed by the laborers \nand 3.5% by the employers. From these accumulated funds \nare taken the allowances for the sick and the unemployed mem¬ \nbers of the Social Security System and the retirement and dis¬ \nability benefits accruing to the laborers. \nTwo other important laws safeguard the health and eco¬ \nnomic well-being of the laborers.

At the \nend of 1958, about 9% or 10% of the total labor force of 8.5 \nmillion was unemployed. Equally serious is the low income of \nthe Filipino wage earners. In 1957, when the gross national \nincome was P8,799 million, only 41.5% of the amount represent¬ \ned wages and salaries of workers and employees. This index is \nlow compared with those of other countries: 49.1% for Japan \nand 58.7% for Australia. The same condition exists today (1969), \nbut the unemployed labor force has increased dangerously. \nBad Features of Philippine Labor:— On paper, it would seem \nthat labor is united and, therefore, strong. Actually, however, \nPhilippine labor is divided against itself owing mainly to, first, \ndifferences in principles, and second, personal ambitions of \nsome leaders. Mergers of union have failed in the past because \nof the insistence of some labor leaders on a certain degree of \nautonomy from the parent organization, a demand that was not \ntaken seriously by those in power. On the other hand, labor \nleaders seldom agree, personally and in principles, with one \nanother. Instead of unity there is rivalry which, at times, takes \nthe form of busting each other’s head. Labor rivalries in the \nwater front are frequent and too scandalous to elucidate. Early \nin 1959, the labor unions grandiloquently announced the for¬ \nmation of a super-organization, the Kalipunan tig mga Mang- \ngagawang Filipino (KMP), but no sooner had President Garcia \nspoken to them at a banquet at the Manila Hotel than some \naffiliated unions withdrew from the parent organization alleged¬ \nly on a question of principle. On September 6, 1969, the two \nbiggest labor unions — The Philippine Trade Union Councils"

These leaders or, properly misleaders, would \ninstigate a strike against management for the ostensible purpose \nof increasing wages. After days or weeks of negotiations, the \nleaders, having been prevailed upon by management to accept \na “gift” of, say, P50,000, would then tell the striking laborers \nthat the company would be in the red if they persisted in their \ndemands for wage increases. Would they want the company to \nclose shop and consequently for them to lose their jobs? The \nnaive laborers would look at one another and meekly submit \nto management. \nAnother instance of dishonesty on the part of certain labor \nmisleaders is the so-called kickback. In this practice, the labor \nleaders compel the workers to “come across,” that is to say, to \ngive a part of their daily wages to the former, through the capataz \nor foreman, who sees to it that all pay their “dues”. A com¬ \nplaining or reluctant laborer is promptly punished by excluding \nhim from the next job, thus depriving him of the opportunity \nto earn an honest living. Collectively, the laborers, being un¬ \ndisciplined in labor ways, invariably “come across,” thereby \nencouraging and perpetuating the system of exploitation. \nStill another dishonest practice is that in which the labor \nmisleader hires his laborers for, say, four pesos a day. Actually \nmanagement pays him six or seven pesos per laborer per day. \nThus, the misleader gets between two and three pesos per la¬ \nborer per day. If he has, say, 500 laborers in the payroll, he \nearns a cool PI,000 at two pesos per laborer and PI,500 a day \nat three pesos per laborer. Little wonder that some labor lead¬ \ners, with comparatively small salaries as heads of their labor \nunions, live like princes. \nOne other bad feature of labor in the Philippines is the work¬ \ner’s lack of civic sense. Nurtured under a tradition of close family \nrelations, the laborer thinks only of his family and forgets the \nlarger issue of the class to which he belongs. A striking union \nfails because scabs act as strike-breakers, and they do‘so because \nthey think in terms of their families and not of the welfare of \nthe laboring class. Much of the failure of labor strikes in the \nPhilippines lies in the failure of the individual worker to make"

These three planks have \nbeen, and continue to be, implemented in various ways. The \nfirst plank has been criticized by the nationalists for its sub¬ \nservience to the United States in the belief that the interests \nof the Republic do not always coincide with the interests of \nthe United States. The second plank, which includes closer \nties with the countries of Asia, has also been criticized for not \nhaving been implemented to the letter. The nationalist view¬ \npoint has been that the foreign policy of the Republic must be \nrooted in its national interests since the essence of any foreign \npolicy is to work for the interests of the country. The Garcia \nAdministration had, so far, led the way in anchoring its foreign \npolicy on the Filipino First principle. \nForeign Policy Planks-When the Philippines finally regained \nher independence on July 4, 1946, she found herself, so to speak, \nbalancing on a bamboo pole placed across a river. Destitute \nand suffering from the effects of the recently concluded war, \nher political leaders could only look to America for assistance \nand economic salvation, for it was with America that the country \nhad conducted the experiment in mass democracy and with \nwhom she had fought the grim war. These historic ties, popularly \nand misleadingly called “special relations with the United States,” \ndetermine the direction of Philippine foreign policy. According¬ \nly, when President Roxas stood up to deliver his inaugural address \nthat morning of July 4, 1946, he laid down the first plank of \nPhilippine policy: the closest cooperation with the United States \n“in all matters concerning our common defense and security. ” \nOne result of the war was the partial liquidation of West¬ \nern imperialism in the Orient leading to the political emancipa¬ \ntion of Pakistan, India, Ceylon, Burma, Indonesia and Malaya. \nWith the emergence of these Asian states, the Philippines, as a \ngeographic entity of Southeast Asia, became tangent to its dev¬ \nelopment.

This sentiment was \nexpressed by then President Sergio Osrnena and affirmed by \nsucceeding Presidents. The third plank, therefore, of Philippine \nforeign policy is the full and active participation of the Philip¬ \npines in the ideals and work of the United Nations. \nFirst Plank: Implementation—The first plank of Philippine \nforeign policy revolved around Filipino-American relations. The \nchange from colonial status to independence necessitated read¬ \njustments in the relations between the Philippines and the United \nStates. Consequently, the two countries entered into treaties \nand agreements designed to continue the close friendship that \nhas existed between them approximately since 1902. The Philip¬ \npines accepted, having then no better alternative, the Bell Trade \nAct and the Tydings Rehabilitation Act of 1946 in order to \nproceed with the rehabilitation and reconstruction of damaged \nagriculture, industries, buildings, roads, bridges, and schoolhouses. \nRecognizing that the recent war had “confirmed the mutuality \nof interest” of the Philippines and the United States “in matters \nrelating to the defense of their respective territories,” and that \nmeasures should be taken to promote their security, the Philip¬ \npines and the United States concluded, on March 14, 1947, a \nmilitary agreement by which the former granted the latter the \nright to “retain the use of bases in the Philippines” for period of \nninety-nine years, to permit the United States to use such bases \nas the latter may determine according to military necessity, and \nto enter into negotiations with the United States concerning \nthe expansion of such bases. Ostensibly the military bases are \ndesigned to strengthen the American armed forces in the Philip¬ \npines in order to enable her to protect the latter from external \naggression. While this may be true, it is nevertheless true that, \nin a world divided between democracy and communism, those \nforces are designed also to protect American interests in Southeast \nAsia."

In the first place, the so-called identity of \nFilipino-American interests is more sentimental and rhetorical \nthan real and substantial. No two independent nations ever \nhad or could have identical national interests, owing to geographic, \neconomic, and ideological factors. In the second place, there \nare actuations of the American Government and personnel which \ndo not conform to the Filipino idea of friendship. Lastly, the \nFilipinos, or the more intelligent and vocal among them, have \ncome to realize that American intentions in the Philippines have \nnot been exactly altruistic and benevolent. \nWhen the Philippines achieved independence in 1946, President \nRoxas lost no time in enunciating his policy of following in the \nwake of America in the mistaken belief that what is good for \nAmerica is or must necessarily be good for the Philippines. Con¬ \nsequently, every American imposition was accepted blithely \nin the belief that what America does in the Philippines and \nelsewhere is done for the good of the Filipinos. In practically \nall international questions, the Philippines, through her delegate \nto the United Nations, has almost always voted with the United \nStates until, in 1959, Filipino Ambassador to London, Leon \nMa. Guerrero, Jr., cried bitterly that the U.S. delegation to the \nU.N. had been “twisting the arm” of the Filipino delegation, \nthat is, putting pressure on the latter in order to vote as one \nwith the U.S. delegation on matters favorable to the United \nStates even if, in some matters, the reputation of the Philip¬ \npines is adversely affected.

This conflict of jurisdiction \nhas increased the tension. \nIn 1953, President Quirino and President Eisenhower com¬ \nmunicated with each other on the importance of expanding and \ndeveloping “certain U.S. military bases in the Philippines, as \nwell as outstanding property and related questions.” Nothing \nresulted from this exchange of letters. Owing to bloody in¬ \ncidents in which alleged Filipino pilferers were shot down like \ndogs inside the American bases, the House of Representatives, \nin February 1956, took steps to re-examine Philippine-American \nrelations. This move was inspired by the detention of Enrique \nSanta Maria, a Filipino mining operator, by the Clark Field \nauthorities for mining in Bueno Hill, Capas, Tarlac, which was \nwithin the American reservation. To resolve the bases ques¬ \ntions, particularly the question of jurisdiction, both countries \nappointed their respective panels to meet in Manila. The Phil¬ \nippine panel, chairmanned by Vice-President Carlos P. Garcia, \nmet with the American panel, headed by Karl Bendetsen, from \nAugust 11, 1956 to December 5, 1956. The Philippine position \nregarding the bases question, was provided by Senator Claro \nM. Recto when, on February 1, 1954, he refuted Attorney Gen¬ \neral Herbert Brownell’s contention that the United States own¬ \ned the land on which the American bases were located. Recto \ncontended that the United States merely acquired the right to \nuse such land. Two years later, in July 1956, the American \nGovernment declared that the United States “recognizes the \nsovereignty of the Philippine Government over the base lands.” \nThis was repeated by Vice-President Richard Nixon when he \nvisited the Philippines the same year. Thus, Recto was justified \nin his contention. \nThe Garcia-Bendetsen conferences concerning the question \nof jurisdiction in the American bases in the Philippines ended \nin December 1956 without having arrived at a reasonable so¬ \nlution.

The irritant became exceedingly \nirritating to the Filipinos when, in 1964, a Filipino boy in Clark \nField was shot in the back by an American sentry. This was \nfollowed shortly by the killing of a Filipino fisherman by Amer¬ \nican sentries at the Olongapo Naval Base. University students \nand laborers held vocal but peaceful demonstrations before the \nAmerican Embassy in Manila and denounced what they believed \nwas the unnecessary and unjustified killing of unarmed Filipinos. \nThe American Embassy, in its attempt to explain away the murder \nof the Filipino boy, issued a statement saying that certain Fili¬ \npinos tried to bomb the American school at Clark Field. A \nbomb was shown to the press, but subsequent investigations \nshowed that the bomb was a harmless one and could not have \nexploded. Thinking Filipinos felt that the bomb was planted \nto make it appear that Filipinos who came near the airfield threw \nthe bomb at the American school. The excuse was palpably \nlame, and the Filipino students, laborers, and some intellectuals \nheld a mammoth demonstration before the American Embassy \non January 25, 1965, and denounced American actuations in \nthe Philippines. The Americans, seconded by their Filipino \nstooges, immediately branded the demonstration as communistic, \nbut this smear tactic had the effect of fanning anti-American \nfeeling. \nThe killing of unarmed Filipinos by armed American soldiers \ninside or outside American military and naval bases in the Philip¬ \npines continued. In 1968, a Filipino was shot to death by an \nAmerican sentry in Cavite. The following year, another trigger- \nhappy American soldier, who was off duty and, in violation of \nU. S. military rules, went hunting with his service pistol, in broad \ndaylight shot to death a Filipino employee of the military base. \nWhen confronted with the murder, the American soldier said he \nmistook the Filipino for a “wild boar.” The .American military \ncourt hastily tried the offender and acquitted him. A few days \nlater, he was reported to have left for the United States.

Another irritant, \nso the Filipinos believe, is the failure of the United States to \nsatisfy Filipino claims for payment, among which are the $500 \nmillion in salaries due the Philippine Army men and guerrilla \nunits for wartime service, the $100 million in back pay to Fili¬ \npinos who served with the American regular army, the $21.5 \nmillion for supplies and services rendered in 1941 by the Philip¬ \npine Government to the U.S. Armed Forces, and the $5.5 million \nspent by the Philippine Government in processing Philippine \nclaims against the United States Government.

The modification, in the words of Secretary \nof Foreign Affairs Felixberto Serrano, lay in a policy of “respect¬ \nable independence.” The year 1959 was fateful, for it saw the \nbeginnings of a nationalistic orientation, along Recto’s line of \nthinking, not only in foreign policy, but also in the national \neconomy. The increasing demand of the more farsighted and \nnationalistic sector of the population for a re-examination of \nPhilippine-American relations, particularly with reference to \nparity, the 1947 Military Bases Agreement, the Laurel-Lang- \nley Agreement, and the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty, led to a \nseries of conferences between Secretary Felixberto Serrano and \nAmbassador Charles K.

Blair, Jr. signed an agree¬ \nment revising Article XIII of the 1947 Bases Treaty. Under \nthe agreement which, however, does not have the effect of law, \nthe United States agreed to (1) renounce exclusive jurisdiction \nover on-base offenses, (2) define clearly the term “on-duty”, \n(3) improve the provisions on waivers of jurisdiction, and (4) \ncreate a criminal jurisdiction implementation committee com¬ \nposed of officials of both governments. \nContributing to the relaxation of tension was the accord \nreached on October 23, 1959, which as finally signed in Manila \non October 28, in which the United States turned over Olongapo \nto the Philippines. Olongapo, a part of Subic, Zambales, had \nbeen administered by the American Naval authorities and had \nbeen, for all practical purposes, an American territory where \nFilipinos were considered aliens. With its turnover to the Philip¬ \npine Government it became, in theory and in fact, a part of the \nPhilippines, and thereby removed one source of irritant between \nthe Filipinos and the Americans in that part of the country. \nRe-assessment of RP-US Relations.—Owing mainly to the \nAmerican military’s unseemly behavior in their dealings with \nFilipino civilians, especially inside the military bases, many \nthinking Filipinos have in recent years begun to doubt the reality \nof the so-called special relations with the United States. The \nFilipinos as a people were, however, more to blame than the \nAmericans for they, the Filipinos, had not learned the lessons of \ntheir history and had not realized that in international relations \nthe first duty of a people is to protect their national interests. \nThe myth of “special relations” with the United States was"

This \nnaivete, which is not even charming, has been the focus of point¬ \ned criticisms of the nationalists who warned the Filipinos against \nrelying too much on the United States and hinted, in broad \nstrokes, that the salvation of the Filipino nation lay, and still \nlies, in self-reliance and self-help. For this dignified, although \nthen unpopular stand, the nationalists were called prophets of \ndoom and communist sympathizers by the “brown Americans.,, \nSenator Claro M. Recto, in particular, was called nasty names by \ncertain Filipinos who, either because of their ignorance or slave \ncomplex, fanatically believed in American benevolence and mag¬ \nnanimity and who, therefore, favored President Manuel A. Ro- \nxas’ “follow-in-the-wake-of-America policy”. \nIn recent years, however, an increasing number of Filipinos \nhave been re-assessing Philippine-American relations and have, \nas a consequence, come to the conclusion that the so-called spe¬ \ncial relations with the United States was a myth. The national¬ \nists, in particular, began to criticize American policy toward \nthe Philippines and demanded in unmistakable terms the abo¬ \nlition of the parity right of the Americans in the Philippines, \nthe dismantling of the American bases, and the termination \nin the ranks, the nationalists in all sectors — teachers, students, \nof the Laurel-Langley Agreement.

A. N.). The national¬ \nists urged the people to stand on their own feet and to rely on \nthemselves for their salvation. This appeal echoed in essence, \nAndres Bonifacio’s exhortation to the masses in 1896. Signi¬ \nficantly, the nationalists stood, and still stand, for an independ¬ \nent foreign policy, the control and direction of the national \neconomy by Filipinos, and an end to the so-called special rela¬ \ntions with the United States. \nThis last, the end of the so-called special relations, was force¬ \nfully and frankly brought to the attention of the Filipinos by \nno less than President Richard M.

In the \nimplementation of the second plank, the Philippines supported \nthe cause of Indonesian independence, and sponsored or actively \nparticipated in conferences concerning cultural, economic, and \nsocial questions that were and continue to be of paramount \nimportance to the Orient, such as the New Delhi Conference \nof 1949, the Baguio Conference of 1950, the conferences of \nthe Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE), \nand the Bandung Conference of 1955. It may be said that the \ndecade from 1950 to 1959 was an era of Asian rediscovery and \nre-awakening. Heretofore, owing to the incursions of Western \nimperialism in the Orient, the Asian peoples lived in isolation \nand were not allowed by the imperialist powers to know and \nunderstand one another. The Philippines under Spain and the \nUnited States; Malaya, India, and Burma under Great Britain; \nIndonesia under Holland; and Indo-China under France were, \nso to speak, islands drifting aimlessly and without any appreciable \nknowledge of one another. With Philippine independence, followed \nclosely by the independence of India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Ceylon, \nViet-Nam, and, lastly, Malaya, the ancient relations among them \nhave been resumed. Since then they have been working at redis¬ \ncovering, first, their separate national identities, and, second, their \ninterdependence in cultural, social, and economic matters. Cul¬ \ntural and diplomatic exchanges have been, and continue to be, \nmade among the Southeast Asian countries leading to closer \nunderstanding and amity. The Philippines concluded treaties \nof frienship with Pakistan on January 3, 1951; with Indonesia \non June 21, 1951; with India on July 11, 1952 and on April \n29, 1954; with Viet-Nam on April 26, 1959; and a cultural colla¬ \nboration pact with Indonesia on April 28, 1959.

The signing of this \ntreaty proceeded from an awareness of the relentless march of \ncommunism in Asia. At the conclusion of World War II, West¬ \nern imperialism in Asia suffered a setback and a wave of na¬ \ntionalism swept over that part of colonized Asia. In this post¬ \nwar confusion, communism stepped in and, identifying itself \nwith the struggling colonials, acquired large supplies of weapons. \nMost of the countries of the region were then ripe for communist \npickings, for poverty, filth, and hunger led to desperation which \nmade the people clutch at the communist straw. The pattern \nof communist movement first showed itself in Indo-China in \n1945-46 when the native communists gained control of the \nguerrilla movement and instigated the revolt against French \nauthorities. Communist subversion spread to other parts of \nSoutheast Asia, principally in India, Indonesia, Burma, Mala¬ \nya, and the Philippines. The movement gained momentum when \nin 1949, Chinese communist armies of Mao Tse-Tung overran \nthe Chinese mainland and drove Chiang Kai-shek to a hide-out \nin Formosa. On June 24, 1950, the Communist North Koreans \ninvaded South Korea, forcing the United Nations to contribute \nfighting forces and relief materials to South Korea. In July \n1953, an armistice was signed ending the Korean blood bath. \nBut a year later, the communist-led Viet-Minh (Northern Indo- \nChina) invaded and overran the northern provice of Tonkin \nand advanced into Laos. This Indo-Chinese little war was halt¬ \ned in 1954 by the decisions of the Geneva Conference which \nprovided for the temporary withdrawal of communists and French \nforces to zones north and south, respectively, of the 17th parallel. \nViet-nam, Cambodia, and Laos were recognized as independent \nstates. \nThe dangers posed by the communist movement to the \nWestern Powers’ position in Asia and to the independent exist¬ \nence of some Southeast Asian countries led Secretary of State \nJohn Foster Dulles to propose, on July 23, 1954, the formation \nof “collective arrangements to promote the security of the free \npeoples of South-East Asia.” Prince Wan Waithayakom of Thai-"

On \nSeptember 6, President Magsaysay, speaking at the opening \nconference, stated its objective: \nIt is the task of this conference to help build an adequate \nsystem of defense around an exposed and threatened sector o. \nthe world. On the success of this conference may well depend the \npeace of Asia in the next ten years and the future freedom in the \nworld for the next thousand years. \nOn September 8, the representatives of the countries in \nattendance approved and signed the Manila Pact, which was \ndesigned for the defense of Southeast Asia against armed ex¬ \nternal aggression. At the same time, they also approved the \nPacific Charter. The Manila Pact provides for the peaceful settle¬ \nment of international disputes in which they might get involved, \nthe pooling of their resources in an effort to resist any armed \nattack and to “prevent and counter subversive activities directed \nfrom without against their territorial integrity and political sta¬ \nbility,” cooperation with one another in the promotion of their \neconomic and social well-being, and a concerted action in the \nevent outside aggression is directed against any of its members \nin accordance with the constitutional processes of each of the \nmember states. \nOn February 19, 1955, the SEATO formally came into being \nwith the ratification of the treaty by all the member-states. \nThougfi well-conceived and well-intentioned, the SEATO never¬ \ntheless suffered from one capital weakness, namely, that it did \nnot include the more important states of Southeast Asia, such \nas Indonesia, India, Malaysia, and Burma. # Of the eight member \nstates, three — the United States, the United Kingdom, and \nFrance* — were outside the area, while two — Australia and New \nZealand — were so far off that it is doubtful whether in the event \nof communist aggression, say, against Thailand, they jwould or \ncould be effective in giving aid to the aggrieved nation. With \nIndia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Burma refusing to join the alliance, \nthe SEATO was at best effective on paper."

It was \nthe time of the “cold war” and the United States, now hostile \nto Soviet Russia, was exerting efforts to win nations to her side. \nThe United States could not afford to lose the ideological war. \nRoxas was invited by the American military at Clark Field, an \nAmerican enclave in the Philippines, to speak before the American \nsoldiers to spell out officially the Philippine stand on the Russo- \nAmerican “cold war.” Roxas, who owed his election to the \npresidency to the Americans — mainly to MacArthur and McNutt \n- eloquently committed the Filipino youth to the American side. \nRoxas, of course, had been anti-communist as shown by his out¬ \nlawing of the communist-led Hukbalahap organization, which \nopposed him vigorously in the 1946 elections. Upon his death \non the very day that he delivered his “follow-America-wherever- \nshe-goes” speech, his successor, Quirino, and the other presidents \nafter him, made anti-communism a credo. \nOn September 24, 1956, the British scholar, Arnold Toynbee, \nthe celebrated author of the massive The Study of History, spoke \nat the Philippine Columbian Club and was asked, after his lecture, \nwhether he was in favor of outlawing communism. His answer \nwas shocking to the intelligence community and the professional \nwitch-hunters. He was, he said, against out-lawing communism, \nfor this would only force the communists to go underground. \nThe wisdom of his remark was proved when Congress, during \nCarlos P. Garcia’s administration, passed the Anti-Subversion \nLaw, which outlawed communism in the Philippines. The hand¬ \nful of Filipino communists promptly went underground, and the \nintelligence agencies resorted to unfounded suspicions, unreason¬ \nable accusations, and plain prejudice to harass and smear the \nreputation of men and women who refused to swear by con¬ \nformism and parochialism. \nThe period from approximately 1950 to 1967 may be de¬ \nscribed as the era of witch-hunting. Professors, labor leaders, \nand students with liberal orientation were branded “pinks” or \n“Reds” or “fellow-travelers”, thus making them suspect in the \neyes of the public.

In- \n■ \nstead, he partially relaxed the ban on travel to communist coun¬ \ntries, a relaxation that led to the acceptance by Filipinos, some \nof whom were legislators and newspapermen, of invitations to \nvisit Red China. By 1968, businessmen, legislators, and news¬ \npapermen had gone not only to Red China, but also to such \ncommunist countries as Soviet Russia, Romania, Yugoslavia, \nPoland, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany to know more about \nthese countries and to lay the ground for future trade and cul¬ \ntural relations with them. In the same year, Russian scholars, \nsome of whom could speak Tagalog better than many Filipinos, \nwere allowed to enter the Philippines, and in 1969 some Russian \nballet dancers were invited to perform at the Meralco Auditorium. \nAnother group of Russians, composed of a lady scholar of Philip¬ \npine history, a journalist, and a bureaucrat, came to Manila for a \nvisit and were invited to many parties given in their honor. Such \nreception would have been labeled communistic in the 1950’s. \nEven so, there are still Filipinos who think in terms of the \n“cold war” of the late 1940’s and the 1950’s and, consequently, \nwould not hear of any relations with communist countries. Re¬ \ncent developments, however, show them to be dwindling into the \nminority. Even the rabid Catholics who trembled with holy in¬ \ndignation at the mere mention of communism have revised their \nattitude and are now more or less resigned to accepting trade \nand cultural relations with communist countries. The reason \nfor this turnabout lies not only in the recognition of the hard \nrealities of international politics, but also in the changes that \nhave swept — and are still sweeping — the Vatican precisely \nsince the liberal-minded Pope John XXIII ascended the papal \nthrone. The ecumenism which he began is being continued by \nhis successor, Pope Paul VI. This ecumenism has resulted in the \nliberalization of the Church’s thinking and practices, including \nthe recognition of the necessity to co-exist with people of oppo¬ \nsite or even hostile ideological orientation. \nThe conditioning of the Filipino officials’ minds to absolute \nanti-communism, even to the extent of being ridiculous, has \nnot made the Philippine position in Asia enviable.

In accordance with the under¬ \nstanding between the two countries (see preceding paragraph), \nthe Philippines renewed its claim over Sabah, the former North \nBorneo. The Philippine claim was based on the following his¬ \ntorical facts: \n1. The “sultan of Sulu acquired sovereignty over North \nBorneo (Sabah) from the Sultan of Brunei in the early 17th \ncentury” whom the former helped in suppressing a rebellion; \n2. In 1878, the Sultan of Sulu leased* North Borneo (Sa¬ \nbah) to an Austrian national, Gustavus von Overbeck, who organ¬ \nized the North Borneo Company with Alfred Dent, an English¬ \nman, as his business partner. The Company administered the \ndisputed territory from 1878 to 1946 and during this period \nit paid the Sultan of Sulu an annual rental of 5,000 Malayan \ndollars, which was increased in 1903 to 5,300 dollars: \n3. The fact that the disputed territory was leased by the \nSultan of Sulu shows that he exercised sovereignty over the \nterritory; \n4. In 1903, the North Borneo Company, a private company, \nasked the “Sultan of Sulu to execute a confirmatory deed to \nconfirm the contract of 1878 (the Lease Agreement)” and “ex¬ \npressly recognized that the Sultan of Sulu was sovereign in Sabah”; \n5. According to British sources, the North Borneo Company \ndid not acquire the territory of Sabah for the British crown, \nfor when Spain and the Netherlands raised objections over the \nactivities of the North Borneo Company, Lord Granville and the \nMarquis of Salisbury, who were during their time Foreign Minis¬ \nters of Britain, explained to Spain and the Netherlands that \n*The contract of lease of 1878 used the Tausog word “padjak” which, \naccording to Dutch, American, and Spanish scholars, means “lease.” The \nSpanish documents of the period called the transaction “arrendamiento” \nwhich means “lease.\" The British, quite naturally, translate the word to \nmean “cession.” It is, however, surprising to note that the Company and \nthe British Government paid the Sultan of Sulu and annual rental of 5,300 \nMalayan dollars up to 1963.

In \nJanuary 1959, during Tunku Abdul Rahman’s visit to Manila, \nhe and President Garcia issued a joint communique which called \nfor a study of the “ways and means to elevate the standard of \nliving and improve the material welfare of their peoples.” It \nwas proposed, however, that other Southeast Asian countries be \ninvited to “subscribe to this idea.” On July 31, 1961, the As¬ \nsociation of Southeast Asia was formally established in Bangkok \nby the representatives of the Philippines, Malaya, and Thailand. \nThe aims, as expressed in the so-called Bangkok Declaration, \nwere: \n1. To establish an effective machinery for friendly consulta¬ \ntions, collaboration and mutual assistance in the economic, social, \ncultural, scientific and administrative fields; \n2. To provide educational, professional, technical and ad¬ \nministrative training and research facilities in their respective coun¬ \ntries for nationals and officials of the associated countries; \n3.

Moreover, the Spanish Law forces the students to sacrifice \nother more important subjects, particularly the sciences and the \nhumanities, in order to enable them to take twenty-four units \nof Spanish. On the practical side, the twenty-four units of Spanish \nin colleges and universities have not made any appreciable contri¬ \nbution to the student’s reading and speaking knowledge of Spanish. \nStudents study Spanish simply to qualify for graduation and do \nnot evince any desire to learn the language.7 The result is waste \n7 Spanish should be made compulsory for students specializing in Philip¬ \npine history and in modern languages.

On \nthe contrary, many features of colonialism remain today. For \none thing, education is predominantly American. English re¬ \nmains the language of instruction except in the first grades of \nthe primary level in some provinces. Both in concept and tech¬ \nnique, the educational system follows that of the United States. \nThe result is confusion in the language situation, on the one \nhand, and continuance of Filipino literature in English, on the \nother. Social changes, too, follow the pre-American and American \ncolonial pattern in which there is an unequal distribution of wealth. \nThis condition has resulted in social upheavals and in the multi¬ \nplication of grave social problems. \nEducation.—The Philippines has an educational system that \nis patterned after the American tradition of education. At first \nprimarily conditioned to the basic concepts of American demo¬ \ncracy, the educational system emphasized Americanism rather \nthan Filipinism. The change of status from colony to Common¬ \nwealth, and from Commonwealth to Republic, has not so far \nradically changed the old educational pattern, for even today \nany modification in the American system is exultantly followed \nin the Philippines — years later when the modification has lost \nits validity in the United States. Thus, many years after “in¬ \ndependence,” the Philippine educational system is still American- \noriented, resulting in the perpetuation of colonial mentality. \nThis was deplored by no less than former Senate President Arturo \nM. Tolentino, a brilliant legal scholar and legislator, who, in \nOctober 1966, called on the educational leaders of the Philippines \nto reorient the educational system in such a way as to imbue \nthe Filipino youth with a real sense of independence. He also \nurged that English be discontinued as a medium of instruction \nbecause it is inconsistent with the independent status of the \nPhilippines. “The continued use of English as a medium of \ninstruction,” he said, “has created subconscious feeling that \nwhatever comes from the United States is better than what we \ncreate in the Philippines.” Concluding his speech, he said that \nthere was, and is, a necessity for freeing the mind of the youth \nfrom colonial mentality. \n547"

The effect of the first has been to awaken \nthe interest of the students in the role played by the Filipinos \nin the development of Philippine polity. The second, as exper¬ \niments have shown, has increased the school child’s learning \nand self-assurance, for in using his own language he loses the \ninhibitions and inferiority complex that characterize his pain¬ \nful study of a foreign language. The third has prepared, and \ncontinues to prepare, many of the non-academic type of students \nfor useful occupations thereby diminishing the number of mis¬ \nplaced white collar job seekers and contributing, to a certain ex¬ \ntent, to the economic development of the growing national \ncommunity. \nHigher Education.—Appetite for higher education since the \nend of the last war has been whetted. The result has been in¬ \ncreased college and university enrollment. The University of \nthe Philippines, because of its rigid rules and regulations gov¬ \nerning scholarship and because of its limited funds, could not \naccommodate the growing population of college students. This \nvacuum has been filled by private colleges and universities. The \nincrease in the number of private institutions of higher learning \nsince independence means that more and more students have \nbeen attracted to higher education in order to acquire status \nsymbol. Such proliferation of private colleges and universities \nhas given rise to the problem of what has been derisively called \n“diploma mills.” The cut-throat competition among private in¬ \nstitutions has resulted in the graduation of half-baked students \nwho could hardly write a grammatical sentence. Thus, theoreti¬ \ncally there has been an increase in the percentage of college \ngraduates since the Liberation. Actually, however, many of \nthese graduates are no better than the high school graduates of \nthe pre-war years. \n1 Even as these lines are being, written-January 1960—the Department \nof Education is reported to have re-examined its policy of using Tagalog \nin the first two grades and is contemplating to revert to the old practice, \nthat is, the use of English from Grade I up. This decision is, as reported \nin the press, being taken in spite of the successful experiments conducted \nin the use of the vernaculars in the first grades of the primary."

Mora¬ \nles of the University of the Philippines, “bankrupt in finances \nand values.” On the other hand, the private institutions, with \nfew exceptions, are bankrupt in values, though not in finances. \nOn the higher level, many private schools and colleges are run \nfor profit, and since profit-motive predominates over serious \neducation, faculty members are employed not because of their \ncompetence — some, however, are very competent, — hut be¬ \ncause of the low salaries they are willing to accept to keep body \nand soul together. Low salaries mean more profits for the col¬ \nleges but less learning for the students who, in many cases, are \nusually only thirty minutes behind their mentors. The net re¬ \nsult of such a system has been the increase in the number of \nunemployed graduates which, in turn, has led to grave social \nproblems. \nThe Community Schools.—One of the significant changes \nin the educational field was the introduction of the concept of \ncommunity schools. In 1948, some enterprising and resourceful \nsuperintendents of public schools started experimenting with \nthe community schools. The division superintendents of Bataan, \nBulakan, Cebu, Cagayan, Iloilo, and Pampanga began to apply \nmore thoroughly than it had been attempted before this concept \nof education by which the activities of the schools are integrated \ninto those of the community. In 1950, the convention of public \nschools superintendents adopted a program of community devel¬ \nopment through the schools. \nThe community school concept is primarily geared to the \nimprovement of the social, economic, and health conditions of \nthe rural areas. The schools use actual situations and problems \nin the community as subjects of study. The community in turn \nreceives help from the schools in the form of instructions in \nagriculture, health and sanitation, literacy, and home industries. \nNo set formulas are followed in all school divisions; the \nmethods and approach to the problems of the community de¬ \npend on the conditions of each locality. Three approaches have \nbeen evolved: the so-called Bataan approach, the Iloilo approach, \nand the Laguna approach. Each of these is named after the \nprovince where the method is employed. \nThe Bataan approach emphasizes the establishment of village \nnurseries where seedlings are distributed at nominal cost to the"

Crop rotation, the use of \nfertilizers, poultry raising, gardening, and pig raising are taught \nto the adults by their own school children. \nIn Laguna and Bulakan, the »adults are taught the methods \nand techniques of grafting, raising hogs and ducks, breeding, \nfeeding, and disease control. The improvement Of the living con¬ \nditions in the community is the common objective of all these \ntechniques. \nThe Philippine community school movement has begun to \nattract international attention. It was the object of consider¬ \nable interest during the first United Nations Conference on Com¬ \nmunity Development for South and South East Asia held in \nManila from November 29 to December 10, 1954. The main \nresults of this Conference were that the members2 v \n1. outlined the essential elements of a concrete plan for \ncommunity development; \n2. exchanged information on the policy, structure, successes \nand failures of their own programmes; and \n3. suggested methods for increasing regional cooperation \nand achieving better utilization of the services of the international \norganizations to promote community development. \nThe Language Situation.-The Philippines has been both \n.fortunate and unfortunate in having been conquered by foreign \nPowers. The almost four centuries of for3ign domination have \nmade many Filipinos polyglots. Through the acquisition of \nSpanish and English, educated, Filipinos have come into contact \nwith the cultural and scientific works of the most advanced \ncountries of the world. As a consequence, they have imbibed \nthe Western cultural tradition. But, on the other hand, the acqui¬ \nsition of this Western cultural orientation has resulted in the \nsubmergence of those Asian values which are the bases of a \nnational culture in evolution. Thus, many Filipinos, while learned \nin foreign languages and literatures, are grossly ignorant of their \nown. Some, like Dona Victorina of Rizal’s Noli, take pride in \nknowing more Spanish or English than their native language. \n2 The Philippines, Indonesia, India, Pakistan, and Korea. The repre¬ \nsentatives of the UN and its agencies also participated in the discussions."

Thus, the average Filipino is confused and spirit¬ \nually uprooted from his native habitat. \nThis situation, as has been intimated, is the upshot of for¬ \neign conquest. First, a small number of Filipinos learned Span¬ \nish and became the social and cultural £lite. While the friars \ncontributed much to the preservation of the Philippine languages, \nthe Filipino Slite, who had acquired a slavish mentality, never \ncared to follow up the friars’ lead and maintained, instead, an \nattitude of superiority over those who spoke their own languages. \nThus, some Filipino families used Spanish in their homes and \nbrought up their children in ignorance of their own. Such attitude \nwas copied by a segment of the lower class who, possessing more \nimagination than wisdom, proceeded to evolve a kind of Spanish: \ncha bacano — a vulgarized Spanish liberally sprinkled with vulgarized \nnative words and phrases. \nSecond, with the coming of the Americans the Filipinos \nlearned another foreign language. Spanish continued at first to \ndominate the circle of high society, but in the 1930’s it gave \nway to English. At the same time, the Philippine languages \ncontinued to be-used in the homes, while Tagalog, the language \nof the capital and the provinces around it, successfully held \nits own against English and Spanish. The young generation \nbecame the purveyors of English and made it the medium of \ncommunication among themselves. With the inauguration of \nthe Commowealth, Tagalog began to assume a national role. \nIt is now taught in the schools and, since 1946, has been one \nof tha official languages of the country. Rightly or wrongly, \nthe purveyors of English blame the teaching of Tagalog as a \nprimary factor in the deterioration of English in the Philippines. \nThe language situation in which Filipino children are taught \na language foreign to their daily lives and community experience \nhas persisted to this day. It presents a problem in the schools \nwhere, aside from Tagalog, the students learn English and their \nnative languages. The confusion was compounded when Spanish \nwas made compulsory in universities and colleges.

The argument is vicious, for no \nlanguage can be developed if it is not given a chance to be used \nnationally. Language is something that is evolved; it does not \nspring from the head of Athena complete and fully developed. \nIf Tagalog, as the basis of the national language, has not developed \nas its devoted exponents devoutly wish it to be, it is because \ninfluential Filipinos themselves, owing either to colonial mentality \nor to regional prejudices, are opposed to having a national lan¬ \nguage of their own and prefer to fool themselves into believing \nthat they are masters of a foreign one whose nuances they do not \neven understand. , Self-deception is the worst tragedy of the \nFilipinos as a people. \nThe Filipino Language.—The bitter controversy that arose \nfrom the national language issue led the authorities of the Depart¬ \nment of Education to propose a solution by using Pilipino, instead \nof Tagalog, as the national language. The reason is based not on \nany scientific explanation but on purely practical ground, namely, \nto neutralize the bull-headed opposition of the professional \nanti-Tagalog by not mentioning the word Tagalog which, to the \noppositionists, smacks of superiority. So Tagalog is now being \nused only as a basis but is not the national language, although \nto all appearances Pilipino, or the national language, is patently \nTagalog. \nSo as not to arouse the suspicion of the non-Tagalogs, some \nwriters in Pilipino try to dilute the language not with words \nfrom other Philippine languages — although theoretically this \nshould be done — but from English. Sentences are liberally \nand indiscriminately sprinkled with English words and phrases, \nthus making the alleged Pilipino language Taglish (Tagalog and \nEnglish) or Engalog (English and Tagalog). Such expressions \nas “Dito sa aming area ay very good ang tubo ng mga plants”; \n“Iyan pong mga vendors sa streets ay pinagbabawalan ng mga \nauthorities na huwag magdistribute ng mga propaganda leaf¬ \nlets”; “Love na love si Juana Kay Pete who is jobless”, etc., \nare becoming common not among the common people, but \namong the college students.

Thus, announcers say “groserya” for grocery; “supprta- \nhan” for support, and many others. From these, one concludes \nthat the announcers think in English, translate (or think they \ntranslate) the terms into Spanish and then “Pilipinize” them. \nThus, “groserya” is what the announcers think is the Spanish \ntranslation of the English grocery, when the fact is that this \nword is not grocerta in Spanish but almacen de comestibles. \nGroceria in Spanish means grossness. On the other hand, supor- \ntahan is supposed to be the “Pilipinized” form of the Spanish \nsuportar, but the English support, in the sense of backing up, \nsay, a candidate, a movement, and the like, is not suportar in \nSpanish but apoyo. The meaning of suportar is to carry or ease \nanother fellow’s burden.

The writers, though chafing under external \nrestraints imposed by the conquerors, were nevertheless free \nto write on any subject save the ugly side of the Occupation. \nThey wrote on pre-war social problems which, since approxi¬ \nmately the early 1920’s, had been neglected in favor of fantasy \nand romances. In the post-war years, they began to turn to \nthe war experiences and produced, for the most part, propa¬ \nganda literature. A few literary magazines appeared during the \nfirst years after the Liberation, the most prominent among them \nbeing Malaya, Ilang-Ilang, Sinag-Tafa, Liwayway, and Bulaklak. \nThe last two, because of their popular appeal, still exist.

It has super¬ \nseded the novel, which reached the apex of popularity in the \nsecond decade of the century. The writers of the 1930’s and the \npost-independence era belong to a group who have imbibed \nmuch of American civilization. It is, therefore, not surprising \nthat the practitioners of the art should follow in the footsteps \nof Hemingway, Saroyan, Poe, Gale, Anderson, Faulkner, and \nothers. While a few of the writers have declared their independ¬ \nence from foreign authors, many still continue to copy the style, \neven the mannerisms, of the latter. Significant stories since the \nlast war have been written by Genoveva D. Edroza-Matute, Serafin \nC. Gunigundo (who changed his surname to Gunigundo* for polit¬ \nical purposes), Macario Pineda, Elpidio P. Kapulong, Hilario \nCoronel, Pablo N. Bautista, and Pedro S. Dandan, whose works \nhave been included in short story anthologies. Of the latter, \nfive have appeared since 1946: Mga Piling Katha (1947), collected \nand edited by Alejandro G. Abadilla; Ang Maikling Kwentong \nTagalog: 1886-1948 (1949); collected and edited with ahistorico- \ncrjtical introduction by Teodoro A. Agoncillo; Ako’y Isang Tinig \n(1952), a collection of the stories and essays of Genoveva D. \nEdroza-Matute; Ang Maikling Kathang Tagalog (1954), collected \nand edited by Alejandro G. Abadilla; and Mga Agos sa Disyerto \n(1964), a collection of stories by the young writers of the 1960’s. \nThe encouragement of the short story came in 1951 when a \nliquor manufacturer founded the Carlos Palanca, Sr. Memorial \nAwards for Literature (Tagalog and English) and offered PI,000 \nfor the best short story of the year, P500 for the second best, \nand P25Q for the third best. The best stories for each year are \npicked by the literary editors who submit their entries to the \nBoard of Judges. The defect of this method, at least in the Taga¬ \nlog division, is that the preliminary choice of entries is left in \nthe hands of editors who cannot distinguish between a short \nstory and a novel. This defect became obvious in 1952 when the \nmembers of the Board of Judges, confronted with many bad stories \nsubmitted by the editors, had to pick the best among the worse. \nMany well-written and significant stories were left out of com¬ \npetition owing to the fact that the editors could not understand \nthem. \nPoetry, the favorite of the Tagalogs, has become stale.

Hernandez \nwon the Republic Cultural Heritage Award and the National \nArtists Award, the latter posthumously in 1973. His death in \n1970 was a great loss to Philippine literature. \nIn the early 1960’s, some Tagalog poets resuscitated the \nold Tagalog poetic form, the tanagh; Like the Malay pantun, \nthe tanagh is a quatrain and is a poem in itself. It has seven \nsyllables to a line with a monorine, while the pantun has irregu¬ \nlar lines ranging from eight to eleven syllables to a line. Two \ncollections of tanagb have been published: Jose Villa Panganiban’s \nTanaga, Haikku, Pantum (1963) and Alejandro G. Abadilla’s \nTanagabadilla (1965). The former follows the traditional form \nand rime of the tanaga, while the latter reduces the number \nof syllables to six to a line and changes the rime schme to a b a b, \nor alternate rime.

Obviously, \nthese writers have been influenced by the contemporary English \nand American poets whose conscious use of symbols and “special¬ \nized” language has made poetry reading a sort of punishment. \nThere is no need to discuss lengthily the novel and the essay. \nThe novels, with the probable exception of Abadilla and Kapu- \nlong’s Pagkamulat ni Magdalena (1958), Edgardo Reyes’s Sa mga \nKuko ng Liwanag (1966), and one or two others not so distin¬ \nguished, are definitely potboilers. Many of the novels published \nin the popular weeklies derive their inspiration from American \nteleplays and comic trips. The essay, on the other hand, is not \npopular with the public and so even the competent writers seldom \nwrite essays for lack of proper incentive and appreciation. How¬ \never, some critical essays were collected in book form and pub¬ \nlished in 1972. It is Virgilio S. Almario’s Ang Makata sa Panahon \nng Makinay which did not sell more than two hundred copies. \nEarlier, Alejandro G. Abadilla collected some essays and plain \narticles and published them under the title Mga Piling Sanaysay \n(1950), but it never sold more than 500 copies. In the literary \ncontests conducted by the Cultural Center of the Philippines in \n1975, the winning essays had no depth, although the authors \nshow a promise of fulfillment. \nThe drama, which had beep moribund, is now awakening \nand the younger writers, notably Rolando Tinio, Rogelio Sikat, \nDomingo Landicho, Amelia Lapena-Bonifacio, and a few of the \nyoungsters, are showing signs of improving the drama and the \nstage.

The former’s Of Cocks and Kites, though inferior \nto a chapter in Rizal’s Noli which deals with cockfighting, shows \nnative humor at one of its best. Roces’ achievement is all the \nmore significant when one considers that he had not seen the \ninside of a cockpit and that he is a bourgeois — and cockfighting \nis a plebeian pastime.4 Pedroche’s “Ray stories” belong to fantasy \nand their humor depends more on situation than on wit. \nOf Filipino poetesses of the post-war period, Edith K.

This \nproblem of language gains significance when one is confronted \nwith a story in English concerning, say, ajeepney driver or a laborer. \nIn the English story, the poor jeepney driver talks like an Amer¬ \nican with a mastery of the American idioms.

In the first place, mastery of the language today is inversely \nproportional to its wide dissemination, for less and less number \nof Filipinos understand its nuances. In the second place, the \nFilipino writers in English have a very limited audience, a fact \nwhich results from the preceding factor.

This tendency continued down to \nthe end of the American colonial period. In the mid-1930’s, \nhowever, Filipino painters, many of whom had studied in Amer¬ \nican art schools, introduced the so-called modernist concept of \nart. Victorio Edades, Diosdado M. Lorenzo, Hernando R. Ocam¬ \npo, Galo B. Ocampo, Vicente Manansala, and a few others, led \nthe “modernist” school. There was furor not only in the ranks \nof the painters themselves, but also among the laymen and critics. \nIgnacio Manlapaz, wit and art critic, and Guillermo E. Tolentino, \nthe great Filipino sculptor, — both from the University of the \nPhilippines — denounced the new trend as a hoax. Edades and \nthe two Ocampos promptly came to the defense of the “modern¬ \nists” and in turn accused the “conservative” group of misunder¬ \nstanding the nature and function of art. The “critical debate” \nsubsided during the Japanese Occupation, but when the smoke \nof battle was lifted in 1945 the “modernists” found themselves \nenjoying a wide reputation. \nComposed mostly of young men and women, the “modernists,” \nrebelling against the alleged despotic tradition of the School \nof Fine Arts of the University of the Philippines, called for a \ncreative approach to painting, maintaining that painting is not a \n“medium for a story or literature or any extraneous matter \nalien to plastic art.” This individualistic philosophy of art led \nto the rise of the Neo-Realist school of painting. \nOriginally composed of Vicente Manansala, Cesar F. Le- \ngaspi, Hernando R. Ocampo, Romeo V. Tabuena, Victor Otey- \nsa, and Ramon Estella, the school expanded its membership to \ninclude such notable painters as Victorio Edades, Arturo Ro- \ngerio Luz, Fernando Zobel, Diosdado M. Lorenzo, Anita Mag- \nsaysay-Ho, Cenon Rivera, Nena Saguil, Jose T. Joya, Jesus Ay- \nco, and others.

The Orientalism \nin contemporary painting is shown in rich brilliant colors, in \nthe subject of the individual painter, in the decorative tend¬ \nency, and in the calligraphic technique. \nThe same rebellion, but not so intense, that characterizes \nthe development of Filipino painting is shown in sculpture. The \nwood and stone works of Napoleon V. Abueva, the foremost \nsculptor among the Filipino “modernists”, show a radical de¬ \nparture from the classicism of Guillermo E.

Thus, one lay commentator, looking \nat the photographs of some of Abueva’s pieces, acidly commented: \n“Is this modem sculpture?

The primary cause \nof this apathy to Filipino music is the corroding influence of \nthe American popular song hits which fill the air lanes almost \ntwenty-four hours a day. Thus the radio stations, instead of \nexerting a civilizing influence on the audience, actually encourage \nvulgarization of the latter’s taste. The multiplicity of “combos” \nand the dearth of active symphony orchestras present a study in \ncontrast: the vulgar completely dominating the civilized. It is \ntrue, if the newspapers can be relied upon, that there seems to \nbe three or four symphony orchestras, but a close scrutiny of \nthe musicians shows that there is actually only one orchestra. \nHow vulgar the taste of the average Filipino has become is \nshown by a comparative study of the attendance in a “combo” \nexhibition and a concert or stage production.

One significant change \nin the structure, however, is the growth of the middle class. \nMany who, before the war, occupied the lower middle-class \nrung now belong to the middle or upper middle class. The growth \nof the latter may be explained by the increased demand for \nprofessional services and the corresponding increase in the number \nof professionals.

The Filipinos’ \ncapacity for indignation has suffered an atrophy. \nGraft and corruption and influence peddling are the twirl \nresults of a desire to become rich overnight since to be rich is \nto be respected and envied. Graft and corruption had existed \nbefore, but the malady reached its crisis in the post-war years \nwhen opportunities for sudden wealth increased a thousand \ntimes.

Apparently, iron bars do not make a prison, \nfor those are used by the convicts precisely to escape to free¬ \ndom and to threaten society with their presence. \nPoverty has also given rise to a new class known as squatters. \nSocial mobility during the last two decades has been from the \nrural areas to urban centers. Manila and other centers of po¬ \npulation have seen this mobility and have become the focal \npoints of this movement. The result is that the urban centers \nhave become too small to accommodate the “immigrants.” The \nopportunities for marginal existence in the urban centers, gene¬ \nrated by the development of a miniature industrial complex, \nhave been the primary factor in the movement. Since the urban \ncommunities lack sufficient housing facilities, the “immigrants” \noccupy public and private lots on which they build their frail \nbarong-barongs. Such is the number of squatters that unscrupu¬ \nlous politicians, thinking only of the squatter votes, take up their \ncause and fight in court to protect the “rights” of the squatters \nto ignore the rights not only of the community, but also of \nprivate individuals. \nMany squatters, however, are not indigent people; they are \nwell-to-do men who take advantage of official laxness to stake \ntheir claims on public domain. When the latter is subdivided \nfor sale to the public, the well-to-do squatters sell their “rights” \nto the highest bidder. \nThe “immigrant” squatters have posed a problem to the \ncommunity, for their houses are fire hazards and their surround¬ \nings a threat to public health. More than the problem of safety \nand sanitation, however, is the moral problem involved, for \nsome squatters’ areas have been transformed into a paradise \nfor women of easy virtues.

The “fall” of the old agrarian aristocracy has been \ncaused partly by the development of commerce and industry. \nAggressive and, to a certain extent, imaginative men of the lower \nand middle classes have gone and are still going into commerce \nand industry with a perseverance never before witnessed. This \ngroup of men, or at least many of them, does not depend on \nthe old way of thinking that one’s prestige depends on one’s \n“aristocratic” family background. The prestige they have built \nor are building depends on the concentration of wealth and \npower in their hands. These dimensions — wealth and power \n— have succeeded in pushing into the background the “aristo¬ \ncratic” families whose prestige lay in the possession of haciendas, \nthe symbol of wealth and power from the Spanish times to the \noutbreak of the second World War. The abrupt changes in the \neconomics of wealth and power occasioned by the last war caught \nthe members of the landed aristocracy flatfooted and consequent¬ \nly threw them out of gear. A few are adapting themselves to \nthe demands of the “new” economics’7 but the majority, either \nbecause they could not reconcile themselves to the rise of the \nnew rich or because of lack of initiative, have been relegated to \nthe background. \n7 “New” economics is used here advisedly not in the Keynesian sense, \nbut in the sense that the sources of wealth have shifted from the old agri¬ \ncultural to the commercial and industrial field. This is something new in so \nfar as Philippine economy is concerned."

It is now used \nsparingly and only by those who, having fallen under the influ¬ \nence of the feudalists features of the Spanish period, have a \nhard time shaking off the nomenclature from their minds. Alta \nsociedad or high society is now mostly composed of traders, \nbusinessmen, and industrialists and their daughters and wives \nwho spend most of their time in clubs. During the pre-war years, \nonly daughters and sons of the landed aristocracy could become \nmembers of exclusive clubs; today, membership in such club is \nopen to those who, irrespective of family origins and backgrounds, \nhave the money to throw away. Thus, the “new” economics \nhas partially, if not completely, democratized Filipino society. \nWhile the new bourgeoisie are acquiring wealth they are, \nat the same time, trying to win political power. This attempt \nat political consolidation is being done indirectly through polit¬ \nical puppets, politicians who have risen from the lower and \nmiddle classes and who are in need of padrinos or sponsors to \nmaintain their positions in the political institutions. This is not \nnew, for even during the heyday of the landed aristocracy polit¬ \nical puppets were common. The only change noted is in the \npuppet-politician’s shift of allegiance from the aristocracy to \nthe new bourgeoisie. It is the duty of the puppet-politician to \nprotect and to enhance the interests of his padrino or the class \nto which the latter belongs. Failure to do so means withdrawal \nof the padrino's support and, consequently, disaster for the \npolitician. \nQuite recently, or since the elections of 1965, quite a number \nof new millionaires who have risen from below were elected \nto the Senate and the House of Representatives. It would be \nnaive to suppose that they would not use their millions to pro¬ \ntect and advance their business interests. Thus Congress is be¬ \ncoming the paradise of plutocrats. Labor, meanwhile, is un¬ \nrepresented, although many lawmakers make it a point to de¬ \nliver speeches praising the laborers and making wild promises. \nThe gathering wealth and power of the new bourgeoisie has not \nso far led, or at any rate is not yet leading, to the determination \nof national command decisions, although in a few instances it \nmay have had. The reason is that the process of consolidation \nis still going on and has not yet reached the point where the new \nbourgeoisie are too strongly entrenched for any group to oppose."

Demonstra¬ \ntions were not unknown in Manila long before the second world \nwar, for the students of the University of the Philippines, described \nby intelligence agencies as the hotbed of radicalism, held de¬ \nmonstrations against the actuations of those in power. Thus, \nin the early 1930s the students of the University, led by Wences- \nlao Q. Vinzons, who was to become delegate to the Constitutional \nConvention (1934), assemblyman, and governor of his native \nCamarines Norte, held a huge demonstration before the Legis¬ \nlative Building (the present Congress Building) to protest a “rider” \nin a bill providing for increases in the salaries of the legislators. \nPeaceful and orderly, the demonstration aroused public opinion \nagainst the inclusion of a “rider” in what appeared to be a harm¬ \nless bill, and Senate President Manuel L. Quezon, reading the \nprotest correctly, withdrew the offensive “rider” from the bill. \nThe immediate post-war years were years of conformism, of \nindifference even, when there was hardly a student voice raised \nagainst “special” relations with the United States, or against \nthe rampant graft and corruption, or against the abuses of those \nin power. It was a period of re-adjustment after three years \nof suffering and hunger, and the students, concerned with how \nto continue their studies which were temporarily halted during \nthe Japanese occupation, did not realize, or refused to realize, \nthe magnitude of the national problems confronting the people. \nIt was not until the late 1950s that the Filipino students finally \nawakened to the dynamics of society and realized that it was \ntheir duty, no less than their elders’, to commit themselves to the \ncrucial questions vexing the leaders of the nation. Surprisingly, \nthe first stirrings of an awakened social conscience were mani¬ \nfested in protests against the actuations of certain Americans \nwho had not stopped believing that the Philippines was still a \ncolony of the United States. But the protests, though clear, \nwere not loud enough to attract nation-wide attention. \nIt was in the early 1960s that the students found the courage \nand the power to unite and to hold mass rallies and demon¬ \nstrations not only against certain actuations of the Americans, \nbut also against the behavior of some leaders in the government"

By the second half of \nthe 1960s, the students had already decided to have a say in \nnational affairs and in the affairs of their universities, colleges, \nand even their Church. Compared with students in Western \ncountries, and even in Japan, those in the Philippines were “polite”: \nthere had not been a case in which a mediocre professor or a \nsimpering school administrator was stoned; there had not been \nany manhandling of lazy or arrogant instructor; there had not \nbeen any bloody affair that characterized some student demon¬ \nstrations in Europe, the United States, Latin America, and Japan; \nand there had not been any battle with the police or constabulary \nno matter how abusive these may have been. The years from \n1965 to 1972 witnessed the holding of massive student rallies, \nstrikes, and demonstrations aimed at compelling those in author¬ \nity to give in to their legitimate demands. These demands may \nbe classified into (1) those relating to national and international \nproblems in which the Philippines was involved; (2) those dealing \nwith school administration; and (3) those dealing with reforms \nin the Catholic Church in the country. \nThe growth of student power may be ascribed to (1) the \nincreasing student awareness that reforms in the social, political, \nand economic spheres of the country can be hastened by their \ncommitment to those ideas which would re-structure society \nin such a way as to make it more egalitarian; (2) the inadequacy \nof those in power to come to grips with realities and their refusal \nor reluctance to share the responsibility in national development \nwith the young whose realism is infused with the idealism of \nyouth; (3) the continuing crises in national life brought about \nby graft and corruption in high and low places and by the cynical \nattitude of those who continually speak about virtues and \npatriotism but subvert society by dishonest dealings and by \ngoing into smuggling; and (4) the failure of the older generation \nto appreciate the shift in the bases of a stable society of which \nthe students form a significant segment.

The late 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s saw \nthe development of what has been termed student power. The \n“parliament of the streets,” as the student demonstrations were \ncalled, was basically anti-government and, generally speaking, \nnegative in attitude. The violent demonstrations, supported \nin part by a segment of the laboring class, led to bloodshed and \ndestruction of life and property. Confronted with massive dissent \nand with what he considered the threat of internal subversion \nposed by Jose Ma. Sison’s (“Amado Guerrero”) Communist Party \nof the Philippines, with the New People’s Army (NPA) as its \narm, President Ferdinand E.

In Presidential \nDecree No. 2, dated September 26, 1972, he proclaimed the \nentire Philippines as land reform area. Subsequently, he also \ndecreed that tenants should be given three hectares of irrigated \nrice or com lands and five hectares, if unirrigated. The Depart¬ \nment of Agrarian Reform was created to expedite the transfer \nof land titles to the peasants. The zealousness with which the \nagents of the Department of Agrarian Reform pursued their \nassigned tasks, sometimes too zealous for the comfort of some \npeople affected by the agrarian reform, resulted in the transfer \nof many land titles to landless peasants. \nRealizing the importance of increased production, especially \nof grains, President Marcos, on September 26, 1972, issued PD 4 \nproviding for the creation of the National Grains Authority \nwhich was intended to “effect the desired changes and reforms \nin the social, economic and political structure of society. . . \nSubsequently, when a crisis in rice and com occurred in 1973, \nthe National Grains Authority took decisive steps to minimize \nthe effects of the crisis and to regulate the distribution of the \ngrains in such a way as to make the masses less open to the activi¬ \nties of the hoarders, blackmarketeers, and manipulators of prices. \nTo make the machinery of the government more responsive \nto the demands of the “New Society”, as the martial law regime \nis called, President Marcos issued PD No. 6, dated September 27, \n1972, prescribing the rules and regulations regarding discipline \nin the government service. It was common knowledge that many \ngovernment officials and employees who were doing nothing, were \nimmoral, abusive, ignorant, and inefficient and as such led many \nto believe that the government existed in order to exploit the \npeople. The decree spelled out the grounds for disciplinary \naction against dishonesty, oppression, misconduct, negligence \nin the performance of duties, disgraceful and immoral conduct, \ndiscourtesy, and other misdemeanors which, in the old society, were \nignored or passed over. The first year of the martial law regime \nsaw a change in the behavior of the government officials and \nemployees: prompt service, courtesy, efficiency, and good be¬ \nhavior characterized most, if not all, government functionaries. \nHowever, discipline during the second year of martial law dete-"

President \nMarcos was so scandalized by this development that not content¬ \ning himself with expressing his sorrow, he moved briskly and \npublicly accepted the resignations of many officials and em¬ \nployees whom he considered misfits or else guilty of dishonesty \nor inefficiency. Those who believed themselves not guilty filed \nresolutions of reconsideration and, having been investigated, \nwere reinstated to their positions when they were found innocent. \nTo minimize if not completely eradicate robbery and other \nunlawful activities at night, President Marcos also set curfew \nfrom midnight to four in the morning. Subsequently, it was \nchanged from one to four in the morning. In some cases, curfew \nwas lifted as, for instance, during the celebration of All Saints’ \nDay and such occasions as necessitated activities beyond curfew \nhours. \nThe New Constitution.-When martial law was declared, \nthe Constitutional Convention, which had been meeting since \nthe first week of June 1971 in order to frame a new constitution \nto replace that of 1935, met on September 25, 1972 and “voted \nunanimously” to “continue deliberations on vital issues.” A \nmotion was presented in the Convention to adjourn the plenary \nmeeting until the lifting of martial law. The proposal was defeated. \nConsequently, the convention continued its sessions. When the \nnew charter was finished, President Marcos referred it to the \nCitizens Assemblies numbering 26,000 all over the country. \nThe Kapulungan or General Assembly of all citizens assemblies \nmet from January 10 to 15, 1973 to consider the provisions \nof the new charter. Three questions were submitted to the Kapu¬ \nlungan, namely: (1) “Do you approve of the Citizens Assembly \nas a way of popular government to decide issues affecting our \npeople?” (2) “Do you approve of the new Constitution?” and \n(3) “Do you want a plebiscite to be called to ratify the new \nConstitution?” The first two questions were overwhelmingly \napproved, while the third was overwhelmingly disapproved. \nIn view of the results of the referendum, President Marcos, drama¬ \ntizing the occasion, signed three resolutions before the Kapulu¬ \nngan: (1) Proclamation No. 1102 which announced the ratifica¬ \ntion by the Filipino people of the 1973 Constitution as of noon"

Social stability was thus threatened and what Marxists \ncall a “revolutionary situation” seamed to prevail in a society \nthat was largely feudal. In order to diffuse the growing dis¬ \ncontent which might erupt into an armed uprising or revolu¬ \ntion, President Marcos issued an order urging business corpora¬ \ntions and companies to open their doors to the pubhc, which \nis to say, ownership of the corporations and companies should \nnot be limited to the family circle and to a narrow circle of \nfriends, but should be dispersed to those who were willing to \nbecome stockholders of such business firms. Meralco, which \nchanged ownership, was now owned not by a few but by all \nMeralco customers. Some private companies and corporations \nfollowed suit and sold their stocks to the public. The effect \nwas that wealth was to a degree being filtered to the traditional \n“have-nots,” mostly lower middle class. \nWith regard to lands beyond seven hectares owned by a \nperson, a decree provided for the distribution of land above \nseven hectares to landless tenants, and those who owned seven \nor less were required to till their lands personally. Otherwise, \neven their seven-hectare lands would be divided among the ten¬ \nants upon just payment to the owners. The purpose behind this \ndecree was to distribute lands as equitably as possible and so \nenlarge the middle class with the addition of the former tenants \nwho, by dint of hard labor and patience, have improved their \neconomic life. \nPeace and Order.~The disorders prevalent during premartial \nlaw period were conspicuously absent after the declaration of \nmartial law.

The greatest threat to peace and order came not \nfrom the NPA’s activities, which were not massive in nature, \nbut from the so-called Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), \nof which a former political science student of the University \nof the Philippines is the alleged leader. Because of the casualties \non both the government side and the Muslim secessionists, Pres¬ \nident Marcos initiated a truce movement in February, 1975 by \nappealing to the members of the ASEAN and to the Muslim \ncountries to help force a ceasefire in the affected areas of Min¬ \ndanao and Sulu. He offered amnesty to all those connected \nwith the secessionist movement and promised to bring the Muslims \nto the “level similar to the areas in Luzon.. . .” For this purpose, \nthe President set aside “plenty of money.” Five days later in \nBaguio, President Marcos said that the secessionist movement \nwas “being abetted and sustained” by outside support. During \nthe truce period, however, the MNLF attacked the Philippine \nConstabulary forces in Mindanao, resulting in heavy casualties. \nDisplaying coolness and restraint, President Marcos continued \nto seek ways and means of having fruitful dialogue with the \nMuslim secessionists. He poured millions upon millions of pesos \ninto the Muslim area to show his good intentions as far as the \ndevelopment of the Muslim areas was concerned. At the same \ntime, he invited Muslim countries to investigate the condition \nof the Filipino Muslims in order to determine for themselves \nwhat his government was — and is still — doing to uplift the \ncondition of the Muslim masses. \nPresident Marcos’s drive to win over the dissidents, Christians \nand non-Christians, won a significant victory when the Partido \nKomunista ng Pilipinas (PKP), the Moscow-oriented communist \ngroup, volunteered to cooperate with the President. In a “Me¬ \nmorandum of Cooperation” dated October 1, 1974, and signed \nby Felicisimo Macapagal, secretary-general of the PKP, the PKP \nsaid that “On the basis of your commitment to the interests \nof the Filipino working people, we, Filipino communists, are \nready to carry forward the best elements of the New Society, \nfrom principles to deeds.” Thereupon President Marcos granted"

Victor Corpus, who defected from the Philippine Army \nto the NPA years before. Dante was captured early in the morning \nof August 26, 1976 at a sitio of Mexico, Pampanga. Corpus, \non the other hand, was captured as early as July, but the news \nof his capture was withheld for security reasons. With the capture \nof Dante and Corpus, the military arm of the Communist Party \nof the Philippines (Peking-oriented) was considerably weakened. \nInfrastructure.—President Marcos, realizing the necessity \nfor financial capability to underwrite his infrastructure program, \ndecided to put teeth to tax laws which, in the past, had been \nignored blithely or else circumvented in order to avoid payment \nof correct income tax. The Bureau of Internal Revenue, the \nbiggest money maker, of all the departments of the government, \nand the Bureau of Customs, the second biggest money maker were \nplaced in the hands of dedicated officials who were willing to run \nafter prominent and influential tax payers. At the same time, Pres¬ \nident Marcos issued a decree extending tax amnesty to those who, \ndeliberately or not, failed to pay the correct amount of tax. \nThe campaign to make the Filipinos conscious of their duty to \npay correctly the amount they owed the government led to \nresults beyond even the sanguine expectations of the tax col¬ \nlectors: tax collection rose precipitously to such heights never \nbefore known in the country’s history.

Substantial parts of \nthis huge collection were spent in the construction of first-class \nroads, bridges, highways, irrigation facilities, airfields, improvement \nof airports, school-houses, tenement houses for the poor, improve¬ \nment of Manila’s drainage and sewage, hospitals, dispensaries, \nand homes for the aged and the lepers, and public buildings \nto house government offices.

Recto, described such a policy as “mendicant policy.” \nRecto severely criticized this mendicant policy and pleaded \nfor an independent foreign policy which would do justice to \nPhilippine sovereignty as an independent nation and to Filipino \ndignity. He pleaded for self-reliance, for it was not mete than \nindependent country should not stand on its own feet but instead \nrely almost exclusively on foreign, particularly American, aid. \nEven at the risk of being called communistic or a “fellow traveler,” \nRecto, imbued with high ideals and possessed of a seer’s insight, \nfought for the non-recognition of Ngo Dinh Diem’s South Viet¬ \nnam, which Recto called a puppet of the United States, made \nthe plea that the Philippines live with her neighbors, irrespective \nof ideology, as peacefully as circumstances allowed, and suggested \na non-aligned posture in foreign affairs. A small country like \nthe Philippines, he said, should hot take up the quarrels of the \ngreat nations.

Pres¬ \nident Marcos, grasping the significance of the new realities in \ninternational politics, initiated the shift in Philippine foreign \npolicy when, on May 23, 1975, he delivered a foreign policy \nspeech enumerating six guidelines “to help the country survive \nthe current security crisis in Asia” arising from the American \ndebacle in Vietnam. The guidelines are: \n1. To intensify, along with a broader field, Philippine rela¬ \ntions with the members of the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN); \n2. To pursue more vigorously the establishment of diplo¬ \nmatic relations with the socialist states, particularly with the \nPeople’s Republic of China and with the Soviet Union;"

To find a new basis, compatible with the emerging realities \nin Asia, for a continuing healthy relationship with the United \nStates. \nIn accordance with these guidelines, the Philippines estab¬ \nlished diplomatic relations with socialist countries like East \nGermany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, in 1973; Romania \nin April 1975; the People’s Republic of China on June 9, 1975; \nthe Democratic Republic of Vietnam in August 1975; Jordan \nin March 1976; the Democratic Republic of Kampuchea (Cam¬ \nbodia) in May 1976; and with the Soviet Union on June 2, 1976. \nIn December 1973, the Philippines ratified the long-pending \nTreaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation with Japan. The \nestablishment of diplomatic relations with the socialist countries \nof Asia and Europe not only led to progressive trade relations \nbetween them and the Philippines, but also to cultural exchange \nprograms. The official relations with socialist countries marked \nthe end of the Philippines’s period of mendicant policy in foreign \naffairs and the beginning of a new era of self-reliance and align¬ \nment with the developing countries of Asia, Africa, and South \nAmerica.

In 1975, \nthere were 15.2 million in the labor force, of whom 14.6 million \nor 96.2 per cent, were employed, while 577.6 thousands or 3.8 \nper cent, were unemployed. On the other hand, underemploy¬ \nment remained at 9.2 per cent, of the total labor force. This \nperformance was achieved in spite of the annual average of from \n300,000 to 400,000 increase in the ranks of labor. The Depart¬ \nment of Labor’s agencies - the Overseas Employment Develop¬ \nment Board (OEDB), the Public Employment Office (PEO), \nthe National Seamen Board (NSB), the National Manpower and \nYouth Council (NMYC), and the Bureau of Apprenticeship \n(BA) are mainly responsible for the steady deployment of che \nlabor force in such a way as to give the labor movement the \nimportance it deserves. The Public Employment Office is res¬ \nponsible for locating employment possibilities for job applicants \nin the domestic front, while the Overseas Employment Develop¬ \nment Board is responsible for locating employment abroad. In \n1975, the OEDB and the National Seamen Board successfully \nlocated foreign markets for skilled Filipino labor. During the first \nsemester of 1976, the OEDB was responsible for locating labor \nmarkets abroad for 8,830 Filipino laborers, technicians, and pro¬ \nfessionals. Filipino seamen, too, are in demand abroad because \nof their training and adaptability. In 1975, out of 54,487 seamen \nregistered with the NSB, 23,543 were placed in foreign vessels. \nThis figure does not include those directly hired by foreign- \nowned shipping lines. The effects of this employment abroad \nare, first, the lessening of the number !of unemployed in the \ncountry; second, the projection of the good image of the Filipino \nlaborers, technicians, and professionals abroad; and finally, the \nincrease of the government’s income made possible through \nthe foreign exchange remittances of the workers and professionals \nworking abroad. \nOn the domestic front, the wages of laborers have been in¬ \ncreased to P10.00 a day in Metro Manila and P9.00 outside Metro \nManila, On the other hand, agricultural workers now receive \n(as of December 1976) P7.00 for plantation workers and P6.00 \nfor non-plantation workers. Owing to the continued spiraling \nof prices arising from several factors, one of which was the con¬ \ntinued rise in the price of oil, the cost of living rose to such an \nextent as to affect adversely the workers and employees. Real¬ \nizing the plight of the salariedemploye.es, President Marcos, in \nAugust 1974, issued a decree compelling employers with a capital \noutlay of over one million pesos to give their employees an allow-"

Exception \nto compulsory payment of allowances were those employers \nin distress, that is to say, those incurring losses during the last \nthree years and which, if compelled to pay allowances, would be \nforced to close shop or to lay off fifty per cent of the employees. \nAt almost the same time, President Marcos, realizing the crippling \neffects of inflation especially on the workers and the low-salaried \nemployees, decreed that business firms must pay their employees \na thirteenth-month bonus in order to lighten their burden. \nIn the field of labor relations, the government encouraged \nthe formation of the Trade Unions Congress of the Philippines \n(TUCP) in December, 1975, and recognized it as the restructuring \nagent of the Philippine labor movement. Some twenty-four \nlabor federations were grouped under the TUCP with a total \nmembership of about one million. The restructuring of the \nlabor movement into one union-one industry policy will, it is \nhoped, lead to industry-wide collective bargaining. \nThe Economy: Gains and Losses.—The recessionary tend¬ \nency in 1975 all over the world affected the Philippines. Even \nso, the country has to date (1976) withstood the ill effects of \nthe recessionary pressures and has maintained the growth rate \nof 1974. As a consequence, the Philippines recorded an economic \ngain of 5.8 per cent. The National Economic Development \nAuthority (NEDA) estimated that the country increased its gross \nnational product (GNP) from P40,847 million in 1974 to P43,203 \nmillion in 1975. In gross capital formation, the country posted \na growth rate of 29.1 per cent, in 1975. Agriculture contributed \na growth rate of 4.1 per cent, over 1974. This agricultural growth \nwas explained as owing to the liberal credit policy of the govern¬ \nment and to good weather conditions. \nIn trade, however, the Philippines suffered some losses. The \nspiraling cost of oil imports and the lowering of the prices of \ntraditional exports like sugar, copper and ore concentrates, ply¬ \nwood, coconut oil, logs and lumber, and abaca, led to a trade \ndeficit of PI,164 million in 1975. This deficit is expected to \nincrease in 1976. The lowering of the price of sugar in the world \nmarket, with no hope of immediate relief, led the government \nto increase the price of sugar for domestic consumption obviously \nto cushion the shock of the sugar industry’s debacle and to use"

On the other hand, \nthe gross income of farmers increased by almost one hundred \nper cent. On land transfers (from owners of lands more than \nseven hectares), some 365,000 hectares were transferred to \n207,991 farmers as of November, 1975. Lands below seven \nhectares and placed under leasehold numbered 155,479 hectares \nwith 122,420 farmers tilling the soil. \nThe martial law regime also initiated a resettlement program by \nwhich fanners without lands were resettled in agricultural settle¬ \nments owned by the government. The Department of Agriculture \nowns thirty-three agricultural settlements all over the country. \nAs of the middle of 1976, some 47,712 farm-families had been \nresettled on 282,000 hectares.

Agoncillo’s \n“The Development of the Tagalog Language and Literature” \nand in his draft of a work on the American influence on the \nTagalog literature and language. \nCHAPTER XXI \nThere is a plethora of original sources on the Japanese occu¬ \npation; only the most salient, however, are indicated here. The \nbest sources are easily the occupation Tribune and the Official \nJournal of the Japanese Military Administration Manila, 1942- \n1943), 13 volumes. Theodore Roosevelt’s role in the Philippine \nindependence program is found in Henry F. Pringle’s Theodore \nRoosevelt (Harvest Books, New York, 1956); General Douglas \nMac-Arthur’s role is found in Francis Trevelyan Miller’s General \nMacArthur (Philadelphia, 1945) and in Douglas MacArthur’s \nReminiscences (New York, 1964). The series of events leading to \nthe war is found in the newspaper accounts, principally in the \nManila Tribune and the Manila Daily Bulletin, 1940-1941. The \nmilitary side is ably presented in Louis Morton’s The Fall of the \nPhilippines (Washington, 1953). Manuel L. Quezon’s The Good \nFight (New York and London, 1946) presents the Filipino view¬ \npoint of the war. Critical accounts of the occupation years are \nfound in Hernando Abaya’s Betrayal in the Philippines (New \nYork, 1946) and Eliseo Quirino’s A Day to Remember (Manila, \n1958). A defense of the role of some Filipino officials during \nthe occupation is masterfully presented in Claro M. Recto’s \nThree Years of Enemy Occupation: The Issue of Political Colla¬ \nboration in the Philippines (Manila, 1946). The senior author has \nwritten a two-volume work, The Fateful Years: Japan’s Adventure \nin the Philippines, 1941-1945 (Quezon City, 1965), Jorge B. \nVargas’ role during the occupation is presented in Armando J. \nMalay’s Occupied Philippines (Manila, Filipiniana Book Guild, \n1967). \nCHAPTER XXII \nThere are several good accounts of the guerrilla warfare in \nthe Philippines, each recording the events in a particular place or \narea. The story of the guerrillas of northern Luzon is told in \nGuerrilla Days in North Luzon (Manila, 1946) and R. W. Volck- \nmann’s We Remained (New York, 1954).

The odyssey of the govemment-in-exile is found \nin Quezon’s The Good Flight. \nThe accounts of the naval battles leading to the liberation of \nthe Philippines are found in several good official and eyewitness \nreports: Admiral Frederick C. Sherman’s “The Battles of the Phil¬ \nippine Sea/1 The Manila Times, July 14 to August 5, 1947; Fleet \nAdmiral Ernest J. King’s Second Official Report Covering Combat \nOperations March 1, 1945, a separate pamphlet issued by the \nUnited States News; and Lt. Oliver Jensen’s Carrier War (New \nYork, 1945). A rather highly technical account of the naval and \nland battles is found in H. Hamlin Cannon’s Leyte: The Return to \nthe Philippines. Better and certainly more readable works on the \nsubject are Samuel Eliot Morison’s Leyte: June 1944 — January \n1945 (Boston, 1958) and The Liberation of the Philippines, 1944- \n1945 (Boston, 1959), and MacArthur’s Reminiscences.

An authoritative ac¬ \ncount of the Huk movement is found in Luis M. Taruc’s Born of \nthe People (New York, 1953). The files of Camp Crame are rich \nin Huk lore.

One of the most important sources of information is \nperiodical literature, in the present instance, The Manila Chronicle, \nThe Manila Times, The Daily Mirror, and other papers and maga¬ \nzines. The treaties and agreements concluded by the Philippines \nwith foreign countries are found in the Department of Foreign Af¬ \nfairs’ Treaty Series, 4 volumes, the latest, as of May 1967, being \nVolume IV, No. 1, 1962-1964.

The \nlatter do not condone children talking back \nnot only to them, but to those older than \nthey are. \nThe Filipino is naturally fatalistic. No \namount of expostulation on the virtues of \nscience or logic can dislodge him from his idea \nof fatalism. He believes that whatever happens \nto him is the work of Fate. This fatalism is \nbest symbolized in the phrase \"Baha/a na,\" a \nphrase that defies translation but which may \nbe rendered loosely as \"come what may.\" \nLoyalty to a friend or to a benefactor is \none trait that is very strong in the Filipino. \nDo him a little favor and he remembers you \nto the end of his days. For to the Filipino, \nfriendship is sacred and implies mutual help \nunder any circumstances. A friend is expected \nto come to the aid not only of a personal \nfriend, but also of the latter's family. A man's \nfriend is considered a member of the family \nand is expected to share its tribulations as \nwell as its prosperity and happiness. It is \nalmost unthinkable for the Filipino to betray \nhis friend, and if there be such one, he \nbecomes a marked man: ostracism is the \nlightest punishment that can be meted out to \nhim. \n( over design by MALANG"

Quezon City, University of the Philippines, 1956. \n\"It is an unusually and refreshingly well written Philippine \ndocument.\" — DR. GILBERT S. PEREZ, poet, scholar, critic, and \neducator. \n\"The Revolt of the Masses is a unified work of art. .. [It] is \na distinctive contribution not only to Philippine historiography and \nhistorical literature but to Philippine literature itself.\" *— PROF \nLEOPOLDO Y. YABES, scholar and literary historian. \n• Malolos: The Crisis of the Republic. Quezon City, Univer¬ \nsity of the Philippines, 1960. \n\"Agoncillo is no believer in objectivity, at least in the sense \nthat names-and-dates historians interpret the word.... He is re¬ \nfreshingly opinionated in a profession that is often namby-pamby \nfor fear of arousing controversy, anger, or organized crusades which, \nif he depended for his living on an institution less liberal than the \nstate university, could mean his expulsion from the classroom. \n\"Shortly after The Revolt of the Masses came out an effort \nwas made in certain quarters to link it with what has since been \ncalled 'legal and parliamentary Communism.' The academic witch- \nhunters failed, but they will doubtless try again after they have \nread Malolos which, more effectively than The Revolt, projects \nAgoncillo's overall view of the Philippine Revolution as a struggle \nbetween the 'Haves' and the 'Have nots.'\" — EMILIO AGUILAR CRUZ, \nart critic, essayist, and editor. The Daily Mirror. \n\"One great advantage of Agoncillo is that he writes with ease \nand distinction, being an accepted writer of note in English and in \nthe national dialect_ He can therefore be extremely persuasive in \nhis arguments because cf this literary quality of his writing. He \ninterprets his characters wit!, feeling and the events of history in \nhis hands take on the in vitability, in some instances, of a classical \ntragedy.\" -DR. PUR A SANTILLAN-CASTRENCE, essayist, critic, profes¬ \nsor, and diplomat. \n• The Fateful Ye»«rs: Japan's Adventure in the Philippines, 1941- \n1945. Quezon City, R. P. Garcia Publishing Co., 1965. Two volumes. \n\"The work as a whole is a mine of information, every page \nis of interest, there is grim realism, relieved at times by humor, \nthe tone is balanced and judicious.... the writing is clear and lively. \n— A. V. H. HARTENDORP, art connoisseur, critic, and magazine \neditor. \n\"This is not a dry-as-dust account. Prof. Agoncillo has a vivid \npen and an interesting style_ At last, twenty years after [the] \nevents had taken place, a Filipino historian has come out with a \ntwo-volume work which vividly depicts the plight of the Filipinos \nand. their problems during those years of terror and hardship.... \nProf. Agoncillo has made a definitely valuable contribution to \npine historiography, a book which will be better appreciated ||g3C!U \npeople with the passage of time.\" — CARLOS QUIRINO, biog r, \nBataan, survivor, and former Director of the National Libran \n__ t V’liOj ( • A"
