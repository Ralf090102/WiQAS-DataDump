The still primitive way of agriculture is one of \nthe causes of the failure of the Philippines to produce enough \nrice for export. However, a breakthrough in rice production was \nmade during the first four years of President Ferdinand Marcos’ \nadministration when the so-called “miracle rice” was developed. \nOther products, however, have been raised for export. Cop¬ \nra, abaca, gums, resins, rubber, and sugar have found ready \nmarkets abroad. Lumber, minerals, and metals have been ex¬ \nported in large quantities to swell Philippine exports to an \naverage of about P800,000,000. Mining, which is a basic in¬ \ndustry, produces more than 700 million pesos worth of minerals. \nMetallic minerals, such as copper, gold, silver, iron, lead, zinc, \nmanganese, and chromium are exploited for their commercial \nvalue, while the non-metallic minerals like salt, coal, clay, as¬ \nbestos, sulphur, gravel, limestone, and gypsum are so far not \nyet exploited for large-scale export. It is suspected that oil is \npresent in some Philippine sites, but attempts to locate these \nsites have so far been unsuccessful. \nThe Philippine forests, which cover some 40,000 square \nmiles, produce timber for local consumption and export. Phil¬ \nippine hardwoods are known the world over. However, in re¬ \ncent years, senseless and unscrupulous timbermen have practi¬ \ncally denuded the forests, with the result that the water supply \nof the lowlands has been tremendously lessened and the num¬ \nber of trees considerably reduced. \nThe People .'-The Filipino belongs to a mixture of races, \nalthough basically he is a Malay. Centuries of cultural and \ncommercial contacts with the countries of Asia and almost four \ncenturies of domination by Western Powers have made the Fili¬ \npino comparatively sophisticated. There is in him a blending \nof the East and the West, so that his character exhibits curious \ncontradictions which foreigners are apt to misunderstand. Doubt¬ \nless, the Filipino at the coming of the Spaniards was brown¬ \nskinned like his Malay forebears. With Spanish colonization, \nhowever, there appeared a kind of Filipino who was obviously \nthe result of the not-so-licit relations between the conqueror \nand the conquered. This light-skinned and high-nosed Filipino \nmultiplied with the coming of the Americans.'

The still primitive way of agriculture is one of the causes of the failure of the Philippines to produce enough rice for export. However, a breakthrough in rice production was made during the first four years of President Ferdinand Marcos’ administration when the so-called “miracle rice” was developed. Other products, however, have been raised for export. Cop¬ ra, abaca, gums, resins, rubber, and sugar have found ready markets abroad. Lumber, minerals, and metals have been ex¬ ported in large quantities to swell Philippine exports to an average of about P800,000,000. Mining, which is a basic in¬ dustry, produces more than 700 million pesos worth of minerals. Metallic minerals, such as copper, gold, silver, iron, lead, zinc, manganese, and chromium are exploited for their commercial value, while the non-metallic minerals like salt, coal, clay, as¬ bestos, sulphur, gravel, limestone, and gypsum are so far not yet exploited for large-scale export. It is suspected that oil is present in some Philippine sites, but attempts to locate these sites have so far been unsuccessful. The Philippine forests, which cover some 40,000 square miles, produce timber for local consumption and export. Phil¬ ippine hardwoods are known the world over. However, in re¬ cent years, senseless and unscrupulous timbermen have practi¬ cally denuded the forests, with the result that the water supply of the lowlands has been tremendously lessened and the num¬ ber of trees considerably reduced. The People.'-The Filipino belongs to a mixture of races, although basically he is a Malay. Centuries of cultural and commercial contacts with the countries of Asia and almost four centuries of domination by Western Powers have made the Fili¬ pino comparatively sophisticated. There is in him a blending of the East and the West, so that his character exhibits curious contradictions which foreigners are apt to misunderstand. Doubt¬ less, the Filipino at the coming of the Spaniards was brown¬ skinned like his Malay forebears. With Spanish colonization, however, there appeared a kind of Filipino who was obviously the result of the not-so-licit relations between the conqueror and the conquered. This light-skinned and high-nosed Filipino multiplied with the coming of the Americans.' The inter-marriage between the Filipino and the foreigner, particularly the white, led to a class known as the mestizo class, also humorously called"

Maintaining that he, as soldier or as civilian during the \nlast World War, fought side by side with the Yankee, the Filipino \nbelieves, rightly or wrongly, that he deserves more generous \naid from the United States than, say, the Japanese, who was \na former common enemy. To the Filipino, it is hardly conceivable \nthat the United States should turn out to be an “Migrate”, know¬ \ning as she does that he stood by her in the darkest hour. This \nattitude, on the other hand, is beyond the comprehension of the \nAmerican, for the latter’s understanding of friendship is different \nfrom that of the Filipino. The American is ruthlessly businesslike \nand will not allow sentimentalism to stand in the way of fulfilling \nhis destiny or objective. This “ruthlessness” the Filipino does \nnot understand. Hence the continued misunderstanding between \nthe Filipino and the American with respect to material aid. \nThe American, then, suspects that the Filipino is sensitive. \nHe is. He would not tolerate anyone berating his countryman. \nHe is easily piqued when a foreigner, for instance, makes a sweep¬ \ning generalization that is not flattering to the Filipinos, no matter \nhow true the observation may be. It takes skillful diplomacy, \ntact, or, in more sophisticated language, a great deal of good \npublic relations, to talk to an erring Filipino employee or worker, \nfor a good-intentioned rebuke by a superior might be taken as \na slight on his character or integrity.

Maintaining that he, as soldier or as civilian during the last World War, fought side by side with the Yankee, the Filipino believes, rightly or wrongly, that he deserves more generous aid from the United States than, say, the Japanese, who was a former common enemy. To the Filipino, it is hardly conceivable that the United States should turn out to be an “Migrate”, know¬ ing as she does that he stood by her in the darkest hour. This attitude, on the other hand, is beyond the comprehension of the American, for the latter’s understanding of friendship is different from that of the Filipino. The American is ruthlessly businesslike and will not allow sentimentalism to stand in the way of fulfilling his destiny or objective. This “ruthlessness” the Filipino does not understand. Hence the continued misunderstanding between the Filipino and the American with respect to material aid. The American, then, suspects that the Filipino is sensitive. He is. He would not tolerate anyone berating his countryman. He is easily piqued when a foreigner, for instance, makes a sweep¬ ing generalization that is not flattering to the Filipinos, no matter how true the observation may be. It takes skillful diplomacy, tact, or, in more sophisticated language, a great deal of good public relations, to talk to an erring Filipino employee or worker, for a good-intentioned rebuke by a superior might be taken as a slight on his character or integrity.

These traits, which may be termed \nregional, have been the upshot of economic and social factors. \nThus, in poor isolated regions the inhabitants are frugal and \nindustrious; while in more opulent areas the people are known \nfor their careless abandon and love of the finer things of life. \nBut some characteristic regional traits are, however, difficult \nto explain in precise economic or social terms. \nLet us then begin Horn the north and work our way to the \nsouth. \nFrom the north comes the Ilocano or Samtoy, as he wants \nto be called. An excursion into the northern region reveals \nthat the Samtoy has spilled into the non-Ilocano provinces of \nAbra, Cagayan, Nueva Vizcaya, northern Nueva Ecija, Panga- \nsinan, Zambales, and a part of Tarlac. The Ilocos region is \nhemmed in on one side by forbidding mountain ranges and on \nthe other by the restless sea, so that economic opportunities are \nlimited. The small piece of land that he cultivates is not suf¬ \nficiently fertile to yield abundant crops. Such an environment \ncould only produce adventurous, industrious, hardy, patient, and \nfrugal people. Economic pressure forces him to migrate to \nsome greener valleys either in Mindanao or in Hawaii and con¬ \ntinental United States.

These traits, which may be termed regional, have been the upshot of economic and social factors. Thus, in poor isolated regions the inhabitants are frugal and industrious; while in more opulent areas the people are known for their careless abandon and love of the finer things of life. But some characteristic regional traits are, however, difficult to explain in precise economic or social terms. Let us then begin Horn the north and work our way to the south. From the north comes the Ilocano or Samtoy, as he wants to be called. An excursion into the northern region reveals that the Samtoy has spilled into the non-Ilocano provinces of Abra, Cagayan, Nueva Vizcaya, northern Nueva Ecija, Panga- sinan, Zambales, and a part of Tarlac. The Ilocos region is hemmed in on one side by forbidding mountain ranges and on the other by the restless sea, so that economic opportunities are limited. The small piece of land that he cultivates is not suf¬ ficiently fertile to yield abundant crops. Such an environment could only produce adventurous, industrious, hardy, patient, and frugal people. Economic pressure forces him to migrate to some greener valleys either in Mindanao or in Hawaii and con¬ tinental United States. There, because of his patience, industry, and frugality, he carves out his fortune and most of the time succeeds. He is not one to stay put in a locality if better op¬ portunities in some land beckon. It is for this reason that one finds the Samtoy everywhere in the Philippines. Samtoy frugality is proverbial and compares favorably with that of the Scot. It has been the custom of the Filipino to foot the bill if he happens to invite his companions to, say, a dinner or a round of drinks. It would be difficult for the Samtoy, under the circumstances, to dig into his pockets to take charge of the situation. This is because he earns his money the hard way, and he is not one to nullify his efforts by being a spendthrift. Mention has been made of the barren north. Nature not being so kind to him, the Samtoy finds his surroundings not conducive to humor. Anybody who sees humor in such kind of environment is a bom humorist. The Samtoy is not a bom humorist.

In the lower part \nare enclosures made by stakes and bamboos, where their fowls and \ncattle are reared, and the rice pounded and cleaned. One ascends \ninto the house by means of ladders that can be drawn up, which \nare made from two bamboos. \nAbove are their open batalanes (galleries) used for household \nduties; the parents and children live together. There is little adorn¬ \nment and finery in the house, which is called bahandin. \nAmong the descendants of the Indonesians, such as the \nIlongots and the Kalingas of northern Luzon and the Mandayas \nand the Bagobos of Mindanao, the houses were built on tree tops, \npresumably to prevent their enemies from surprising them in a \nraid. On the other hand, the Bajaos, or Sea Gypsies of Sulu, \nmade their houses in their boats, for they were a sea-roving people \nwhose life depended upon the wealth of the seas. \nSocial Classes:—Philippine society was divided into three \nclasses: the nobles, the freemen, and the dependents.3 The \nnobles, consisting of the chiefs and their families, wielded tre¬ \nmendous influence in the barangay and enjoyed rights that were \nnot usually enjoyed by the other members of society. In the \nTagalog region, they usually carried the title of Gat or Lakan, \nas in Lakan Dula or Gat Maitan. Next to the nobles were the \nfreemen, called mahadlika by the Tagalogs.

Even today, in some places, such \ndependents exist, yet it had not been proper to call them slaves. John Leddy \nPhelan, in his book The Hispanization of the Philippines (Madison, 1959), \np. 20, correctly points out that “To call the pre-Hispanic system of labor \norganization slavery, as the Spaniards in variably did, is misleading.

In the lower part are enclosures made by stakes and bamboos, where their fowls and cattle are reared, and the rice pounded and cleaned. One ascends into the house by means of ladders that can be drawn up, which are made from two bamboos. Above are their open batalanes (galleries) used for household duties; the parents and children live together. There is little adorn¬ ment and finery in the house, which is called bahandin. Among the descendants of the Indonesians, such as the Ilongots and the Kalingas of northern Luzon and the Mandayas and the Bagobos of Mindanao, the houses were built on tree tops, presumably to prevent their enemies from surprising them in a raid. On the other hand, the Bajaos, or Sea Gypsies of Sulu, made their houses in their boats, for they were a sea-roving people whose life depended upon the wealth of the seas. Social Classes:—Philippine society was divided into three classes: the nobles, the freemen, and the dependents.3 The nobles, consisting of the chiefs and their families, wielded tre¬ mendous influence in the barangay and enjoyed rights that were not usually enjoyed by the other members of society. In the Tagalog region, they usually carried the title of Gat or Lakan, as in Lakan Dula or Gat Maitan. Next to the nobles were the freemen, called mahadlika by the Tagalogs. They were com¬ posed of free men and likewise of dependents who had earned their freedom. Occupying the lowest stratum were the depend¬ ents, known as alipin among the Tagalogs. A dependent ac- 2The term arigues is the Hispanized form of the Tagalog haligi or post. So is bahaque, which is the Tagalog bahag. 3 It has been customary for the Spanish writers and for Filipino writers influenced by them to classify society into nobles, freemen, and slaves. Reading carefully the accounts of Antonio de Morga and Juan de Plasencia, one gets the impression that the so-called slaves were not actually slaves in the European sense, but dependents. Even today, in some places, such dependents exist, yet it had not been proper to call them slaves. John Leddy Phelan, in his book The Hispanization of the Philippines (Madison, 1959), p. 20, correctly points out that “To call the pre-Hispanic system of labor organization slavery, as the Spaniards in variably did, is misleading. The whole arrangement had much more in common with debt peonage and share- cropping than it did with the European of chattel slavery.”"

It must be noted, \nhowever, that the lines drawn between the classes were not \nhard; any member of the social classes could go up or down \nthe social ladder depending upon the attendant circumstances. \nAmong the Tagalogs, the dependents were either aliping \nnamamahay or aliping sagigilid. The namamahay had his own \nfamily and house and served his master during planting and \nharvest seasons, rowed for him, helped in the construction of \nhis house, and served his visitors. The sagigilid, on the other \nhand, had no property of his own, lived with the master, and \ncould not even marry without the latter’s consent. Among the \nVisayans, dependents were of three kinds: the tumataban, the \ntumarampuk, and the ayuey. The first worked for his master \nwhen summoned to do so; the second worked one day for his \nmaster; and the third worked three days for his lord. \nThere were gradations among the dependents. The full \ndependent was the son or daughter of dependent parents. The \nhalf-dependent was the son or daughter of parents, one of whom \nwas a full dependent and the other a freeman. The quarter- \ndependent was the son or daughter of parents, one of whom was \na half dependent and the other a freeman. \nThe Position of Women.—Women before the coming of the \nSpaniards enjoyed a unique position in society that their de¬ \nscendants during the Spanish occupation did not enjoy. Cus¬ \ntomary laws gave them the right to be the equal of men, for \nthey could own and inherit property, engage in trade and \nindustry, and succeed to the chieftainship of a barangay in the \nabsence of a male heir. Then, too, they had the exclusive right \nto give names to their children. As a sign of deep respect, the \nmen, when accompanying women, walked behind them. \n* \nMarriage Customs.—There was a custom, not so strictly \nfollowed, in which a man belonging to one class married a \nwoman of the same class. Thus, a chief married a woman of his \nrank; a noble that of his class; and the dependent that of his \nstatus. Nevertheless, this custom was not rigid, and it was \npossible for a noble to marry a dependent or a woman of the \nchieftain class, and a dependent to marry a woman outside his \nrank. A man’s wife was his legitimate wife and was called asawa, \nwhile the other women were euphemistically called “friends”.",

    "content": "EARLY CUSTOMS AND PRACTICES \n41 \nwere highly regarded in the barangay and were considered nobles \nwho were exempted from tributes and services. \nA chieftain had wide powers, for he exercised all the functions \nof government. He was the executive, the legislator, and the \njudge. He was, naturally, the supreme commander in time of \nwar. \nThe inter-baranganic relations consisted in carrying on \ncommerce between barangays and in agreements concerning \nfriendship and alliance. A treaty of friendship and alliance was \nconcluded by means of the blood compact or sangduguan in \nwhich the contracting parties drew blood from their arms and \nmixed the blood thus drawn with the wine in a cup. The con¬ \ntracting parties then drank from the same cup, thereby making \nthem “blood-brothers”. \nWars between barangays occurred when a man from one \nbarangay went to another and was murdered without any ob¬ \nvious cause. Another cause of war was kidnapping the wives \nof men belonging to one barangay. Still another cause was the \nmaltreatment of men of one barangay by men of another ba¬ \nrangay. In these three causes of war there seemed to have been \nvery little or no attempt at all to reconcile conflicts, and the \nresolution of the conflict was brought about by force. Vengeance \nwas the motive power that drove the men of the barangays to \ncut each other’s throat. \nLaws.—Laws were either customary or written. Customary \nlaws were handed down orally from generation to generation \nand constituted the bulk of the laws of the barangay. The written \nlaws were those that the chieftain and his elders promulgated \nfrom time to time as necessity arose.

    "cleaned_content": "EARLY CUSTOMS AND PRACTICES 41 were highly regarded in the barangay and were considered nobles who were exempted from tributes and services. A chieftain had wide powers, for he exercised all the functions of government. He was the executive, the legislator, and the judge. He was, naturally, the supreme commander in time of war. The inter-baranganic relations consisted in carrying on commerce between barangays and in agreements concerning friendship and alliance. A treaty of friendship and alliance was concluded by means of the blood compact or sangduguan in which the contracting parties drew blood from their arms and mixed the blood thus drawn with the wine in a cup. The con¬ tracting parties then drank from the same cup, thereby making them “blood-brothers”. Wars between barangays occurred when a man from one barangay went to another and was murdered without any ob¬ vious cause. Another cause of war was kidnapping the wives of men belonging to one barangay. Still another cause was the maltreatment of men of one barangay by men of another ba¬ rangay. In these three causes of war there seemed to have been very little or no attempt at all to reconcile conflicts, and the resolution of the conflict was brought about by force. Vengeance was the motive power that drove the men of the barangays to cut each other’s throat. Laws.—Laws were either customary or written. Customary laws were handed down orally from generation to generation and constituted the bulk of the laws of the barangay. The written laws were those that the chieftain and his elders promulgated from time to time as necessity arose. Only a few of the written laws, among them the so-called Code of Kalantiyaw and the Muslim laws, have come down to the present because many of them were destroyed by the early Spanish missionaries and many more destroyed by the elements. The laws, customary and written, dealt with various sub¬ jects, such as inheritance, divorce, usury, partnership, crime and punishment, property rights, family relations, adoption, and loans. Criminal laws dealt with felonies, or major crimes, and minor crimes. A recidivist or habitual criminal was punished more severely than the one who committed a first offense.

Taboos were thereupon imposed \nand anybody who had the courage to violate any one of the \ntaboos courted disaster: he was punished by a huge fine, or by \ndeath, or by being made a lowly dependent. With the death \nof the chieftain, all wars or pretty quarrels, if there was any, \nwere ordered stopped; spears were carried with the tips point¬ \ning earthward; daggers were carried with hilts reversed; singing \nin the boats coming from the sea or river was prohibited; and the \nwearing of loud clothes tabooed. An enclosure was made around \nthe house of the dead chieftain and anybody who trespassed \non this enclosure was punished. \nThe superabundant display of lamentations ceased after \nthe funeral. However, eating and drinking continued* and the \nhigher the rank of the deceased the more eating and drinking \nthere was. The relatives of the dead fasted and limited their \nnutrition to vegetables. Among the Tagalogs this fasting was \ncalled sipa. Were the dead man a victim of foul play or had he \ndied in battle, the mourning was not ended until after any of \nthe relatives had exacted his vengeance. This act of avenging \nthe death of a relative was known as balata. Normally, the ninth \nnight after the death of a person was celebrated and was — and \nis still — known as pasiyam. The activities connected with the \npasiyam, such as staging a play in honor of the dead, were called \ntibawan, and the play so staged was called tibaw. \nDivination and Magic Charms.—The ancient Filipinos, like \ntheir contemporaries in many lands, put very much stock in \ndivination, auguries, and magic charms.

Taboos were thereupon imposed and anybody who had the courage to violate any one of the taboos courted disaster: he was punished by a huge fine, or by death, or by being made a lowly dependent. With the death of the chieftain, all wars or pretty quarrels, if there was any, were ordered stopped; spears were carried with the tips point¬ ing earthward; daggers were carried with hilts reversed; singing in the boats coming from the sea or river was prohibited; and the wearing of loud clothes tabooed. An enclosure was made around the house of the dead chieftain and anybody who trespassed on this enclosure was punished. The superabundant display of lamentations ceased after the funeral. However, eating and drinking continued* and the higher the rank of the deceased the more eating and drinking there was. The relatives of the dead fasted and limited their nutrition to vegetables. Among the Tagalogs this fasting was called sipa. Were the dead man a victim of foul play or had he died in battle, the mourning was not ended until after any of the relatives had exacted his vengeance. This act of avenging the death of a relative was known as balata. Normally, the ninth night after the death of a person was celebrated and was — and is still — known as pasiyam. The activities connected with the pasiyam, such as staging a play in honor of the dead, were called tibawan, and the play so staged was called tibaw. Divination and Magic Charms.—The ancient Filipinos, like their contemporaries in many lands, put very much stock in divination, auguries, and magic charms. They interpreted signs in Nature, such as the flight of birds, the barking of dogs, the singing of lizards, and the like, as good or bad omens depending upon the circumstances. Thus, the howling of a dog in the mid¬ dle of the night presaged tragedy or the death of a person. Sneezing, an ordinary human function (particularly when one has a cold), was considered bad omen and those who, for in¬ stance, were about to go on a journey or to war were admon¬ ished to back out, for surely misfortune would overtake them. On the other hand, when a species of bird called salaksak crossed the path of the warriors on their way to battle it meant victory. As to the future, the ancient Filipinos also had their monumental frauds in the persons of the soothsayers, called pangatauhan, who were allegedly endowed with extraordinary powers to tell the fortune of anybody who cared to know be¬ forehand what the days ahead had in store for him."

    "content": "PRE-COLONIAL CULTURE \n61 \n(Ay, my child, my fruit, \nThis I wish to ask of you: \nShould you ever see Kalla, \nExtend to her my regards.) \nIt is obvious that this particular dung-aw is a comparatively \nlate version of the original, for the word pakomusta is of Spanish \norigin, that is, from como esta. The mother, in this song, ap¬ \nparently had previously lost a child named Clara (Kalla in the \nsong), and wanted the other child, now dead, to give her best \nregards to the one in heaven. In such simple words, the song gives \none to understand the close family ties that bind the Filipino \nfamily. \nAlthough by nature lyrical, the Filipinos also wrote sustained \npoetry. They wrote folk epics which to date number no less \nthan twenty. The Ifugaos of northern Luzon had their folk \nepics Hudhud and Alim.

It is obvious that this particular dung-aw is a comparatively late version of the original, for the word pakomusta is of Spanish origin, that is, from como esta. The mother, in this song, ap¬ parently had previously lost a child named Clara (Kalla in the song), and wanted the other child, now dead, to give her best regards to the one in heaven. In such simple words, the song gives one to understand the close family ties that bind the Filipino family. Although by nature lyrical, the Filipinos also wrote sustained poetry. They wrote folk epics which to date number no less than twenty. The Ifugaos of northern Luzon had their folk epics Hudhud and Alim. The Hudhud glorifies Ifugao history, the story centering around the hero Aliguyon. Portions of the Hudhud were usually sung during wedding feasts and on other festive Occasions.

    "content": "UNDER IMPERIAL SPAIN \nThe most spectacular change during the Renaissance which \nshaped the course of history was the opening of the world to \nEuropean shipping. Propelled by “Gospel, Gold and Glory,” and \nsupported by much-improved technology — new types of ships, \nsailing charts and maps, navigational instruments, gunpowder, \nand superior high-powered arms — the two Iberian superpowers \nof Spain and Portugal pushed through their ultimate goals to \ndiscover the rest of the world. With the accumulation of wealth, \npolitical authority, additional empirical knowledge in science and \ntechnology, and the support of a small economic elite, they were \nable to finance several daring reconnaissance enterprises in vast \nunknown, undiscovered seas, and untouched, uncharted con¬ \ntinents. With momentous maritime discoveries, the hitherto \nterra incognita of Asia, with her diverse ancient civilizations and \ncultures, was integrated with Europe. Thus, in the arduous and \nlengthy process of maritime discovery in the late fifteenth century, \nnew sea lanes to Southeast Asia were charted which led to the \nspice trade route. The first of these was initiated by Portugal \nby sailing via the southeastern route which made break-throughs \ninto the Indian Ocean in 1488 and ended with the fall of Malacca \n(1511) and the Maluku or the Moluccas (1512).

Propelled by “Gospel, Gold and Glory,” and supported by much-improved technology — new types of ships, sailing charts and maps, navigational instruments, gunpowder, and superior high-powered arms — the two Iberian superpowers of Spain and Portugal pushed through their ultimate goals to discover the rest of the world. With the accumulation of wealth, political authority, additional empirical knowledge in science and technology, and the support of a small economic elite, they were able to finance several daring reconnaissance enterprises in vast unknown, undiscovered seas, and untouched, uncharted con¬ tinents. With momentous maritime discoveries, the hitherto terra incognita of Asia, with her diverse ancient civilizations and cultures, was integrated with Europe. Thus, in the arduous and lengthy process of maritime discovery in the late fifteenth century, new sea lanes to Southeast Asia were charted which led to the spice trade route. The first of these was initiated by Portugal by sailing via the southeastern route which made break-throughs into the Indian Ocean in 1488 and ended with the fall of Malacca (1511) and the Maluku or the Moluccas (1512). The second was led by Spain by sailing via the western or southwestern route that made serendipitous landfalls in the West Indies in 1492 and culminated in the “rediscovery” of the Philippines in 1521.

It was not until the last quarter of the nineteenth century when such courses as medicine and pharmacy (1871), notary public (1878), philosophy and letters (1896), were in¬ cluded in the curriculum of the University of Santo Tomas. Opened in 1620, the present College of San Juan de Letran was originally founded as the Seminario de Ninos Huerfanos de San Pedro y San Pablo “for orphaned Spanish children.” Since 1640 it was known by its present name and is now considered oldest secondary school in the Philippines. 2. Girl’s Schools.—The first boarding schools for Spanish girls in the Philippines were the Colegios (secondary schools) of Santa Potenciana (1591-1864) and Santa Isabel (1632), now considered the oldest school for girls in the archipelago. They were originally founded for the benefit of orphan Spanish girls. Besides these, exclusive colegios for the daughters of upper-class Spaniards were called beaterios, established for young girls called beatas who led a secluded life. These beaterios included the Beaterio de la Compama de Jestis (now the Religious of the Virgin Mary) founded in 1684; Santa Catalina de Sena (1696); San Sebastian de Calumpang (now Sta. Rita College, (1719); Santa Rita de Pasig (1740); and Santa Rosa (1750). Two of these • beaterios were actually established to teach Spanish culture and values to young Filipinas and were founded by Filipino women: the Religious of the Virgin Mary (RVM Sisters) and the Beaterio de San Sebastian de Calumpang of the 6rden Terciarias de Recole- tos. The nineteenth century saw the establishment of other colegios for women: the Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepcion Concordia, now Concordia College (1868); Looban (1885), and Assumption (1892), which supervised the Escuela Normal Superior de Maestras to prepare Filipino women teachers for the primary schools.

H. Pardo de Tavera blamed the corridos “which consisted \ntheir profane reading,” the pasyons and novenas “which consisted \ntheir religious readings,” as the roots of “ignorantism” left by \nthe Spaniards to the upper and lower classes of Philippines society. \nIn fact, these readings constituted the bulk of the “very poor” \nFilipiniana collection of the first public library and museum \nopened, the Museo-Biblioteca de Filipinos in 1892. Understand¬ \nably, there were no books on political science in the library \ncollection which would have politicized the Filipinos before the \noutbreak of the Philippine Revolution in 1896. \nFolk, as well as colonial art, persisted with the Spanish coloni¬ \nzation. Christianity produced the variegated forms of Filipino \narts and crafts surrounding the religious fiestas. The visual arts, \nlike the making of imagenes, santoses, and jewelry, bloomed \nduring this time. Folk art observed during fiestas are seen up to \nthis day in the whittled bamboo arch decorations (kaluskos), \nmoriones, rosaries, combs, the palaspds, the Christmas parols, \npastillas wrappers, and colorful art presentation in foods served, \nas pan de San Nicolas, atsara (pickles) or sapin-sapm. \nPainting was already secularized, according to the Synod \nof Calasiao in 1773, even as the painters were allowed freely \nto practice their art outside the church a decade later. This \nwas exemplified by the Chinese mestizo painter Faustino Quio- \ntang, who flourished in the 1820s, producing Sedes Sapientiae \nand San Jose with Child Jesus. Damian Domingo, an insular, \ndirector of the Academia de Dibujo from 1827 to 1833, however, \nis considered the first known painter followed by miniaturismo \nartists Juan Arceo and Juan Transfiguracion Nepomuceno and \ntheir families. Two other contemporaries of Domingo were Seve- \nrino Flavier Pablo and Hilarion Soriano. Arceo of Paco, flourish¬ \ning in the 1830s, did religious paintings, and his son, Ysidro \n(“Y.A.”), produced his best works in the 1870s. In the 1840s \nNepomuceno and his son were credited with a series of litho¬ \ngraphic local landscapes and costumes for a French-commissioned \nwork.

T. H. Pardo de Tavera blamed the corridos “which consisted their profane reading,” the pasyons and novenas “which consisted their religious readings,” as the roots of “ignorantism” left by the Spaniards to the upper and lower classes of Philippines society. In fact, these readings constituted the bulk of the “very poor” Filipiniana collection of the first public library and museum opened, the Museo-Biblioteca de Filipinos in 1892. Understand¬ ably, there were no books on political science in the library collection which would have politicized the Filipinos before the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution in 1896. Folk, as well as colonial art, persisted with the Spanish coloni¬ zation. Christianity produced the variegated forms of Filipino arts and crafts surrounding the religious fiestas. The visual arts, like the making of imagenes, santoses, and jewelry, bloomed during this time. Folk art observed during fiestas are seen up to this day in the whittled bamboo arch decorations (kaluskos), moriones, rosaries, combs, the palaspds, the Christmas parols, pastillas wrappers, and colorful art presentation in foods served, as pan de San Nicolas, atsara (pickles) or sapin-sapm. Painting was already secularized, according to the Synod of Calasiao in 1773, even as the painters were allowed freely to practice their art outside the church a decade later. This was exemplified by the Chinese mestizo painter Faustino Quio- tang, who flourished in the 1820s, producing Sedes Sapientiae and San Jose with Child Jesus. Damian Domingo, an insular, director of the Academia de Dibujo from 1827 to 1833, however, is considered the first known painter followed by miniaturismo artists Juan Arceo and Juan Transfiguracion Nepomuceno and their families. Two other contemporaries of Domingo were Seve- rino Flavier Pablo and Hilarion Soriano. Arceo of Paco, flourish¬ ing in the 1830s, did religious paintings, and his son, Ysidro (“Y.A.”), produced his best works in the 1870s. In the 1840s Nepomuceno and his son were credited with a series of litho¬ graphic local landscapes and costumes for a French-commissioned work. One of the painters of note was Antonio Malantic, famous for his detailed paintings of famous portraits dressed in the di- iphanous piha fiber blouse of the mid-1850s. Mariano Asuncion and his six sons, among them Justiniano (“Capit&n Ting”) and Leoncio, and nephews remain the best-known family of reputed"

To inspire further terror on the rebels, three or four adherents were shot and one of the babaylans was burned. The eighteenth century saw some significant revolts in our history : Dagohoy in Bohol, Silang in the Ilocos, Palaris in Pangasi- nan, and Magtangaga in Cagayan. The longest revolt in Philippine history was that of Francisco Dagohoy, a cabeza de barangay of Bohol, taking 85 years (1744-1829) to quell. Although forced labor was one of the causes of Dagohoy’s revolt, it was the Jesuit Fr. Gaspar Morales’ refusal to give his brother, Sagarino, a Christian burial, on the ground that he died in a duel and had not received the extreme unction, that triggered it. Sagarino was a constable of Talibon who was slain while carrying out the order of the same priest. Upon order of Fr. Morales, Sagarino’s rotting corpse was exposed for three days in front of the Inabangan church. With the leading members of the Tagbilaran, Baclayon, and Dauis principalia and some 3,000 men, Dagohoy proclaimed “free Bohol” in Inabangan and Talibon mountains and refused the unjust payment of tribute and rendering of forced labor. How¬ ever, Dagohoy did not live to see the end of the uprising which he successfully initiated. As in other revolts elsewhere, this was a consequence of the realization of the Filipinos that the Spanish might was weak, as proved by their humiliating defeat with the fall of Manila in September 17G2 to the British invaders from the Coromandel coast of India. Pockets of resistance also erupted simultaneous¬ ly in the northern province of Cagayan, and in the hacienda towns of Laguna, Batangas and Cavite. B. Religious Motives.-The continuous Hispanization of the Filipinos through religion was in line with Spain’s policy of “Gospel, Gold and Glory.” Various attempts were made to proselytize the various cultural communities by employing a newly Christianized chieftain or his children and family as shining models for the other barangay members to follow, or by using a Christianized member of a converted ethnic community to evangelize other neighboring unconverted groups. Some of the uncompromising or apostates among them, however, reverted to their old beliefs instead of embracing the new religion. Among them were Miguel Lanab and Alababan (1625-27), Tapar (1663), Francisco Rivera (1718), Ermano Apolinario de la Cruz (1840-41), and, of course, the Muslims in the Southern Philippines, and the Igorots in the Cordilleras."

In 1719, Pangasinan also witnessed a revolt led by Juan Cara- gay, “of very low birth” from Dagupan, galvanized by the tyrannical acts of the alcalde mayor who used force in the unlawful collec¬ tion of tribute and draft labor. While successful in murdering the abominable provincial governor, Caragay was slain later by loyal reinforcements from Dagupan and Binmaley headed by Juan Ramos, marshal-of-camp of Mangaldan, dominated by “Igorots” who chopped off Caragay’s head with just one stroke. Caragay was a mere “bandit” in the eyes of Hie Spaniards who claimed that he molested the people of San Jacinto and Mangal¬ dan. In the late 1750s, Pangasinan experienced untold socio¬ economic restiveness as a consequence of destructive floods and poor harvest, which was further aggravated by the personal excesses of the then alcalde mayor, Joaquin de Gamboa. The regular tribute of one real fuerte (25 centavos) was ordered increased lxh reales more, in spite of the previous natural disasters forcing the already afflicted farmers to pay more than the normal tribute to cover the expenses for the yearly elections and the payments of the acolytes and choir singers. Gamboa, likewise, exacted dried fish from the interior towns during the wet season, ordered a quota of fourteen polistas from every barangay, and to cap it all, controlled the community chest from the town officials. At Binalatongan (now San Carlos City), a principalia member, Juan de la Cruz Palaris, spearheaded a rebellion in 1762 against Gamboa’s personal excesses, which easily spread to the other major towns of the province, reaching as far as the present Tarlac. In the end, Palaris was betrayed by his own sister to the town gobernadorcillo and brought to Lingayen where he was eventually hanged. Receiving the gravest penalty, he was quartered pig-style, with his mutilated head, hands, feet and gouged heart publicly exhibited at the six bridges of Binala¬ tongan to strike terror among the people. Diego Silang, like Palaris, was a principalia, who vehemently opposed the exaction of the comim (annual tribute of one real fuerte), drafting of polistas, and other unscrupulous practices"

Racial Discrimination.—There is an abundance of do¬ \ncumentary proof on racism in the Philippines during the Spanish \nperiod. “Although the laws recognized no difference between the \nvarious races,” commented Pardo de Tavera, “nevertheless from \nthe beginning of the nineteenth century the Spaniards claimed \nsuperiority over the Filipinos, and so taught their children.” He \nelucidates further by saying that \nA \nThe townspeople were obliged to remove their hats when a \nSpaniard passed, and this was especially the case if he occupied \nsome official position; if the Spaniard happened to be a priest; \nin addition to the removal of the hat the native was obliged to kiss \nhis hand. No Indian [i.e., Filipino] was allowed to sit at the same \ntable with a Spaniard, even though the Spaniard was a guest \nin the Indian’s house. The Spaniards addressed the Filipinos [i.e., \nSpaniards bom in the Philippines] by the pronoun “thou”, and \nalthough many of the Spaniards married pure blood native women, \nthe wives were always looked down on in society as belonging to an \ninferior class. \nThe intensity of animosities between the Filipinos and Span¬ \niards, especially the friars, reached the highest point with the \nReform Movement, when anti-Filipino writers like Fr. Miguel \nLucio y Bustamante, Francisco Canamaque, Pablo Feced, and \nWenceslao E. Retana, wrote vitriolic literature denigrating the \nFilipinos. Filipinos were maligned and degraded as “neither a \nmerchant nor an industrial, neither a farmer nor a philosopher” \nor that it was “logical that the Indians, in their immense majority, \nshould receive, from friars and seculars, the epithet of chongos. ” \nThe most virulent attack on the Filipino race came from the \nFranciscan Fr. Miguel Lucio y Bustamante’s Si Tandang Basio \nMacunat (Manila, 1885) who opined that the Filipino could \nnever learn the Spanish language or be civilized. With utmost \nbiases, he differentiated the Spaniards from the Filipino by \nsaying that: “The Spaniards will always be a Spaniard, and the \nindio will always be an indio . . . The monkey will always be a \nmonkey however you dress him with shirt and trousers, and will \nalways be a monkey and not human”.

Racial Discrimination.—There is an abundance of do¬ cumentary proof on racism in the Philippines during the Spanish period. “Although the laws recognized no difference between the various races,” commented Pardo de Tavera, “nevertheless from the beginning of the nineteenth century the Spaniards claimed superiority over the Filipinos, and so taught their children.” He elucidates further by saying that A The townspeople were obliged to remove their hats when a Spaniard passed, and this was especially the case if he occupied some official position; if the Spaniard happened to be a priest; in addition to the removal of the hat the native was obliged to kiss his hand. No Indian [i.e., Filipino] was allowed to sit at the same table with a Spaniard, even though the Spaniard was a guest in the Indian’s house. The Spaniards addressed the Filipinos [i.e., Spaniards bom in the Philippines] by the pronoun “thou”, and although many of the Spaniards married pure blood native women, the wives were always looked down on in society as belonging to an inferior class. The intensity of animosities between the Filipinos and Span¬ iards, especially the friars, reached the highest point with the Reform Movement, when anti-Filipino writers like Fr. Miguel Lucio y Bustamante, Francisco Canamaque, Pablo Feced, and Wenceslao E. Retana, wrote vitriolic literature denigrating the Filipinos. Filipinos were maligned and degraded as “neither a merchant nor an industrial, neither a farmer nor a philosopher” or that it was “logical that the Indians, in their immense majority, should receive, from friars and seculars, the epithet of chongos. ” The most virulent attack on the Filipino race came from the Franciscan Fr. Miguel Lucio y Bustamante’s Si Tandang Basio Macunat (Manila, 1885) who opined that the Filipino could never learn the Spanish language or be civilized. With utmost biases, he differentiated the Spaniards from the Filipino by saying that: “The Spaniards will always be a Spaniard, and the indio will always be an indio... The monkey will always be a monkey however you dress him with shirt and trousers, and will always be a monkey and not human”. In fact, the Filipino, he believed, must remain tied to his carabao: “The Tagalog, that is,"

Rizal returned to the Philippines for the second time — the first was in 1887 — early in 1892 and was promptly arrested and thrown into Fort Santiago. On July 7,1892, his banishment to Dapitan was announced officially. For four years he remained in Dapitan helping his less fortunate countrymen, teaching the young boys how to be good citizens, planting fruit trees, doing some business on the side, writing letters, collecting shells and sending them to his friend Ferdinand Blumentritt in Austria,"

The funds of the society were to be used in the following manner: (1) The member or his son who, while not having means shall show application and great capacity, shall be sustained; (2) The poor shall be supported in his right against any powerful person; (3) The member who shall have suffered any loss shall be aided; (4) Capital shall be loaned to the member who shall need it for an industry or agriculture; (5) The introduction of machines and industries, new or necessary in the country, shall be favored; and (6) Shops, stores, and establishments shall be opened, where the members may be accommodated more economically than else¬ where. Innocent as the society was, the Spanish authorities considered it dangerous and on the night of July 6, 1892, Rizal was secretly arrested. The following day, Governor-General Eulogio Despujol ordered Rizal’s deportation to Dapitan. The Liga languished for a while, but some members continued to support it. The aims remained the same, but it was agreed that all should con¬ tribute toward the support of La Solidaridad in Spain. Domingo Franco was elected President; Deodato Arellano, Secretary- Treasurer; Isidoro Francisco, Fiscal; Juan Zulueta and Timoteo Paez, members of the Supreme Council. Later on, Mabini became the Liga's Secretary. v The Liga was at first act've, but later on its members tired of paying their dues, alleging that the Spanish government did not heed La Solidaridad which they were financing.

Precisely because of the simplicity of his style, the masses understood him and felt the power of his words. Aside from the Kartilla, Jacinto wrote Liwanag at Dilim (Light and Darkness), Pahayag (Manifesto), Sa mga Kababayan (To My Countrymen), Ang Kasalanan ni Cam (Cain’s Sin), Pag- katatag ng P&mahalaan sa Hukuman ng Silangan (Establishment of the Provincial Government of Laguna), and Samahan ng Bay an sa Pangangalakal (Commercial Association of the People). The Teachings of the Katipunan.—Realizing the importance of a primer to indoctrinate the members of the society in its ideals, Jacinto prepared one which he called Kartilla, a word adopted from the Spanish cartilla which at the time meant a primer for grade school students. The Kartilla consisted of thirteen “teachings” which the members of the society were expected to follow. The primer follows: I. Life which is not consecrated to a lofty and sacred cause is like a tree without a shadow, if not a poisonous weed. II. A good deed that springs from a desire for personal profit and not from a desire to do good is not kindness. III. True greatness consists in being charitable, in loving one’s fellow-men and in adjusting every movement, deed and word to true Reason. IV. All men are equal, be the color of their skin black or white. One may be superior to another in knowledge, wealth and beauty, but cannot be superior in being. V. He who is noble prefers honor to personal gains; he who is mean prefers personal profit to honor. VI. To a man with a sense of shame, his word is inviolate."

    "content": "168 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE \nto overthrow Spanish authority. Told that the revolution might \nbreak out prematurely because of the impatience of the masses, \nRizal pointed out that a revolution without sufficient arms should \nnot be started against an armed nation. He remembered the first \nCuban revolution against Spain which failed because of lack of \narms. Even so, he suggested that influential and wealthy Filipinos \nbe attracted to the cause of the society in order to ensure the \nsuccess of the revolution. In such a case, he said, there would \nbe unity among all classes of Filipinos. Knowing that the society \nhad no competent military leadership, he suggested that Antonio \nLuna be appointed to direct all military operations against the \nenemy. Valenzuela pointed out the difficulty of winning over \nthe wealthy Filipinos to the Katipunan side. This was one \nproblem to which Rizal failed to suggest a solution. \nIt is obvious that Rizal was not against revolution in itself, \nbut was against it only in the absence of preparation and arms \non the part of the rebels. This was because Rizal feared that \nwithout arms the rebels would surely be defeated and thereby \ncause irreparable damage to the innocent people. His knowledge \nof the history of revolutions in other lands led him to believe that \nany revolution was useless unless the rebels were at least as armed \nas the enemy. After the interview, Valenzuela sailed back to Manila \nand reported the results of his mission to Bonifacio. The latter, \nhaving been apprised of Rizal’s opinions, admitted that it would \nbe fatal for them to start a revolution without enough arms \nwith which to fight the enemy. \nPreparations for the Struggle.*—Meanwhile, the Katipunan \nbegan preparations geared for any emergency.

    "cleaned_content": "168 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE to overthrow Spanish authority. Told that the revolution might break out prematurely because of the impatience of the masses, Rizal pointed out that a revolution without sufficient arms should not be started against an armed nation. He remembered the first Cuban revolution against Spain which failed because of lack of arms. Even so, he suggested that influential and wealthy Filipinos be attracted to the cause of the society in order to ensure the success of the revolution. In such a case, he said, there would be unity among all classes of Filipinos. Knowing that the society had no competent military leadership, he suggested that Antonio Luna be appointed to direct all military operations against the enemy. Valenzuela pointed out the difficulty of winning over the wealthy Filipinos to the Katipunan side. This was one problem to which Rizal failed to suggest a solution. It is obvious that Rizal was not against revolution in itself, but was against it only in the absence of preparation and arms on the part of the rebels. This was because Rizal feared that without arms the rebels would surely be defeated and thereby cause irreparable damage to the innocent people. His knowledge of the history of revolutions in other lands led him to believe that any revolution was useless unless the rebels were at least as armed as the enemy. After the interview, Valenzuela sailed back to Manila and reported the results of his mission to Bonifacio. The latter, having been apprised of Rizal’s opinions, admitted that it would be fatal for them to start a revolution without enough arms with which to fight the enemy. Preparations for the Struggle.*—Meanwhile, the Katipunan began preparations geared for any emergency. Bonifacio thought that sooner or later the revolution would explode, and he did not want to be taken by surprise. Consequently, he ordered the manufacture of bolos to be distributed to the members of the society. Bolos alone, however, would *not do, for the enemy was armed with Remingtons and Mausers. A ray of hope shone on the Katipuneros when Valenzuela told Bonifacio that the Japanese warship Kongo, with Admiral Kanimura on board, had dropped anchor at Manila Bay and that it might be possible for them to seek the aid of the admiral in the struggle for na¬ tional liberation. Contacts were made through Jose Moritaro Tagawa, a Japanese employee of a Japanese bazaar, and soon the Katipunan committee headed by Bonifacio himself had an interview with Admiral Kanimura.

Led by Mariano Llanera and accompanied by musi- \nkong bumbong (band with bamboo instruments), the rebels at¬ \ntacked furiously but were repulsed by the heroic defense of the \nSpaniards. \nThe Reign of Terror.-The flames that now engulfed many \nprovinces worried the Spanish authorities no end. To frighten \nthe population into submission, the authorities resorted to a \nreign of terror. Only by this means could they hope to prevent \nthe revolutionary movement from becoming national in scope. \nThe Spanish volunteers and Corps of Vigilantes promptly in¬ \nvaded the homes of Filipinos in order to secure evidence against \nthose who were directly or indirectly involved in the uprising. \nIn Trozo, Captain Carlos March of the Spanish Volunteers found \nincriminating evidence against Katipuneros. All suspects were \nimmediately arrested and thrown into jail.

Led by Mariano Llanera and accompanied by musi- kong bumbong (band with bamboo instruments), the rebels at¬ tacked furiously but were repulsed by the heroic defense of the Spaniards. The Reign of Terror.-The flames that now engulfed many provinces worried the Spanish authorities no end. To frighten the population into submission, the authorities resorted to a reign of terror. Only by this means could they hope to prevent the revolutionary movement from becoming national in scope. The Spanish volunteers and Corps of Vigilantes promptly in¬ vaded the homes of Filipinos in order to secure evidence against those who were directly or indirectly involved in the uprising. In Trozo, Captain Carlos March of the Spanish Volunteers found incriminating evidence against Katipuneros. All suspects were immediately arrested and thrown into jail. To localize the dis¬ turbance, Governor-General Ramon Blanco issued a decree on August 30 declaring the provinces of Manila, Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Bulacan, Pampanga, Tarlac, and Nueva Ecija in a state of war and placing them under martial law. The decree further provided that “any person accused of treachery and those against the present form of government” would be handed over to the military court for trial.

The document posed a potential danger to the cause of the Revolu¬ tion, for it meant a definite split in the ranks of the revolutionists and almost certain defeat in the face of a united and well-armed enemy. The Trial and Execution of Bonifacio.—From Naik, Boni¬ facio, his wife, and two brothers, with a handful of loyal fol¬ lowers, transferred to the barrio of Limbon, Indang. The Naik Military Agreement came to the knowledge of Aguinaldo and, realizing the significance of Bonifacio's intentions, he ordered the arrest of the Bonifacio brothers. A group of soldiers under the command of Colonel Agapito Bonzon was dispatched to Lim¬ bon to effect the arrest. Bonzon ordered his men to surround the perimeter of the zone of which Bonifacio’s house was the center. A skirmish was inevitable, and in the firing that fol¬ lowed Bonifacio was stabbed in the larynx, his brother Ciriaco was killed, and his other brother Procopio was wounded. Boni¬ facio was placed in a hammock and brought to Naik, the capital of* the rebel government. On April 28, Aguinaldo forwarded the Bonifacio case to the Council of War in Order “to conduct the necessary trial....

He believed that in such \nperiod as the country was passing through it was necessary to \nhave a strong Executive. But his idea was contradicted by \nCongress when it proposed to draft a constitution. Congress \nadvanced the opinion that a modem constitution answering to \nthe needs of the times was imperative in order to secure the \nrecognition of Philippine independence by foreign powers. Ma¬ \nbini, on the other hand, argued that such a delicate task as the \nframing of the constitution should be done in a peaceful and \nquiet mood in order to give the framers sufficient time to deli¬ \nberate on the proposed provisions.

The Malolos Constitution.—-In preparing the decree of June 18, and that of June 23, Mabini envisioned the Congress to be an advisory body of the President. He believed that in such period as the country was passing through it was necessary to have a strong Executive. But his idea was contradicted by Congress when it proposed to draft a constitution. Congress advanced the opinion that a modem constitution answering to the needs of the times was imperative in order to secure the recognition of Philippine independence by foreign powers. Ma¬ bini, on the other hand, argued that such a delicate task as the framing of the constitution should be done in a peaceful and quiet mood in order to give the framers sufficient time to deli¬ berate on the proposed provisions. At such a period as they were undergoing, it was not proper to frame a constitution. Moreover, Mabini added that Congress was convoked not to frame a constitution, but to advise the President and to give him popular support. Mabini was, however, in the minority, and although his arguments were unassailable he was defeated by the majority under the leadership of Patemo. Nevertheless, Mabini submitted his Constitutional Plan of the Philippine Republic, but Congress, for the second time, overruled him.

The Spanish commissioners were Eugenio Montero \nRfos, Chairman, and Buenaventura Abarzuza, Jose de Gamica, \nWenceslao Ramirez de Villa-Urrutia, and General Rafael Cerero, \nmembers. \nThe Peace Commission met in Paris from October to De¬ \ncember, 1898. Long discussions on legal points took place in \nwhich both sides refused to give in. Finally, the American com¬ \nmissioners served an ultimatum on the Spanish commission¬ \ners who believed that the Americans should be gracious and \ngallant in their hour of victory. But the American commis¬ \nsioners, having been instructed to demand the cession of the \nentire Philippines to the United States, were not in a mood to \nhumor their Spanish counterparts and insisted on their main \ndemand, that is, the cession of the Philippines to the United \nStates. Helpless, the Spanish commissioners finally agreed. On \nDecember 10, 1898, the Treaty of Paris was signed. It provided \nthat Spain would cede the Philippines to the United States in \nreturn for which she would receive $20,000,000 from the United \nStates as payment for improvements made in the colony. Fur¬ \nther, the United States agreed to give the Spaniards the right \nto ship commodities to the Philippines for a period of ten years \non the same terms as those of the United States. \nThe Treaty of Paris did not go into effect until after the \nAmerican Senate had ratified it. The proponents of ratification \ndid not command a majority in the Senate, for many senators \nbelieved that the treaty was unfair to the Filipinos. The un¬ \nfortunate rupture of Filipino-American hostilities on February \n4, 1899 led many opponents of ratification to vote affirmatively. \nThe vote was taken on February 6 and the treaty was ratified \nby two-thirds majority. American propaganda made it appear \nthat the Filipinos fired the first shots that led to the Filipino- \nAmerican hostilities. Consequently, the American senators who \nwere at first against the treaty now voted for it in the belief \nthat the Filipinos caused the rupture of Filipino-American rela¬ \ntions.

The American commissioners were Cushman Davis, William P. Frye, Whitelaw Reid, George Gray, and William R. Day, who resigned as Secretary of State to become Chairman of the American Peace Commission. The Spanish commissioners were Eugenio Montero Rfos, Chairman, and Buenaventura Abarzuza, Jose de Gamica, Wenceslao Ramirez de Villa-Urrutia, and General Rafael Cerero, members. The Peace Commission met in Paris from October to De¬ cember, 1898. Long discussions on legal points took place in which both sides refused to give in. Finally, the American com¬ missioners served an ultimatum on the Spanish commission¬ ers who believed that the Americans should be gracious and gallant in their hour of victory. But the American commis¬ sioners, having been instructed to demand the cession of the entire Philippines to the United States, were not in a mood to humor their Spanish counterparts and insisted on their main demand, that is, the cession of the Philippines to the United States. Helpless, the Spanish commissioners finally agreed. On December 10, 1898, the Treaty of Paris was signed. It provided that Spain would cede the Philippines to the United States in return for which she would receive $20,000,000 from the United States as payment for improvements made in the colony. Fur¬ ther, the United States agreed to give the Spaniards the right to ship commodities to the Philippines for a period of ten years on the same terms as those of the United States. The Treaty of Paris did not go into effect until after the American Senate had ratified it. The proponents of ratification did not command a majority in the Senate, for many senators believed that the treaty was unfair to the Filipinos. The un¬ fortunate rupture of Filipino-American hostilities on February 4, 1899 led many opponents of ratification to vote affirmatively. The vote was taken on February 6 and the treaty was ratified by two-thirds majority. American propaganda made it appear that the Filipinos fired the first shots that led to the Filipino- American hostilities. Consequently, the American senators who were at first against the treaty now voted for it in the belief that the Filipinos caused the rupture of Filipino-American rela¬ tions. The American propaganda, directed mainly by the instru¬ ments of imperialists, won and thereafter the Philippines became a territory of the United States. kl. 4K 4ft."

That same night, however, lsabelo de los Reyes called a meeting of h?s Democratic Labor Union at the Centro de Bellrs Artes and delivered a severely anti-friar speech. He proposed the establishment of a Filipi.io Church independent of Rome with Aghpay as the Supreme Bishop. The proposal was enthusiastically approved. The.icw Church was called Iglesia Fiupina Independiente (Philippine Independent Church). With its founding, the schism with Rome commenced. First Converts—A man of passion and vision, lsabelo de los Reyes was nevertheless over-enthusiastic and pre ipitate. In his desire to give dignity to the movement, he placed in the list of the Executive Committee of the new Church such big names as Trinidad H. Pardo de Tavera, Fernando Ma. Guerrero, Mar¬ tin Ocampo, Manuel Artigas and other eminent lay leaders, and such priests as Adriano Garces, J. Barlin, Manuel Roxas, Toribio Dominguez, and others, without consulting them. These men, though not hostile to the religious movement, were not prepared to lend their names to the new Church. Consequently, they denied any connection with it. The most fatal blow came from Aglipay himself who did not approve of the schism. He believed that all means should be exhausted to come to an understanding with Rome before taking any radical step. At that time, Aglipay was conferring with the Jesuits."

Aglipay exhausted all means to prevent a break with Rome, but the Church authorities tried to divide the Filipinos by courting, flattering, and attempting to bribe Aglipay, the leader of the secessionist movement, in the fond belief that, as in the past, promises of honor and lucre would tempt the leader into be¬ traying the Filipino cause. Unfortunately for them, the na¬ tionalist movement had reached its apex and Aglipay, one of its mainstreams, was a man of integrity whose convictions were not for sale. The Revolution, then, had two results: first, the liquidation of the Spanish empire in the Orient, and second, the alienation of a segment of the population from the Catholic Church. What¬ ever the real motives of the Filipino clergy in joining hands with the revolutionists, the fact remains that the religious schism, which led to the establishment of the Filipino Independent Church, was the most important result of the Filipinos’ struggle for na¬ tional emancipation. The Revolution started as a political up¬ heaval; it ended as a religious triumph. The founding of the Filipino Church showed, finally, that the Filipino clergy had at long last come of age. ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ *"

But American imperialist approach to the Muslim problem, while anchored on a decisive millitary response, included a subtle use of non-military means to create a positive impression of American intention. Thus, in 1903, the “Moro Province” was organized to reconstitute the administrative processes in Mindanao in order to show democracy at work but with American control remaining dominant. A year after, in 1904, with the successful inauguration of the Moro Province with Gen. Leonardo Wood as its first governor, the Bates Treaty was unilaterally abrogated by the United States. While the reason for abrogation given by the authorities, including President William H. Taft, was the failure or ineffectiveness of the Sultan to control the Moros. the actual reason was the need to cut at the outset any political postur¬ ing or leverage the Sultanate had acquired against American sovereignty or supremacy under the Bates Treaty. In this regard, Taft said that with the abrogation of the treaty, the Sultanate was left with no other option but to resist the imperialist deter¬ mination to emasculate the Sultan and, consequently, to destroy the political hold of the Sultanate over its subjects. The armed resistance after 1903 had acquired an ominous nature and pattern in the archipelago and, in a sense, would have some relation to the Muslim resistance in Lanao and Cotabato. Thus, the Muslim"

Pershing assumed the governorship of the Moro Province and started a vigorous “disarmament cam¬ paign” in Jolo, in addition to the educational assault on certain cultural values and practices such as polygamy, pilgrimage to Mecca, etc. The result was the revival of resistance which found tangible expression in the “Battle of Bud Bagsak” in 1913. i /» 5. Bud Bagsak, 1913 Records show that by June 1912, loose firearms had been collected in Jolo, except in Lati and Luuk where the opposition to disarmament was strong. Here began the process for another uprising when Panglima Indanan, a powerful leader, was arrested and disarmed, together with his aides and sons. This was ac¬ companied by the violent operations of the Scouts in the Eastern part of the Jolo, especially in Lati where the sabilallah attacks on American troops became the source of colonial horror. More military pressures were exerted on the Lati people but the latter defied the odds and took their stand at Bud Bagsak. The entire population practically joined the rebellion. The number of defiant rebels was about 6,000 to 10,000, which included about 10 per cent combatants and warriors. It appeared that the whole Lati community was defiant against American rule under circum¬ stances where the killings of non-combatants was a grim reality. The American authorities appealed for non-combatants and combatants to return to their abandoned farms and homes. Finally, many of the non-combatants were persuaded to avoid conflict and only the warriors remained determined to fight the colonial forces. Part of the compromise was the withdrawal of American troops from Jolo island. But peace was uncertain because the Lati Muslims had kept"

Pardo de Tavera was particularly notorious in his con¬ tempt for those below his class. The pro-Americanism of the elite was, to the Americans, not only encouraging but also remarkable for colonial purposes. It would not be long before the ilustrados would find the founding of the Federal Party not only a logical expression of their sentiment but also a political mechanism for helping the colonial administration in the intellectual redirection of the Filipino people. 2. The Cultural Communities In the cultural communities, the Americans were also success¬ ful in coopting the ruling elite at the start of American rule. In the tribal communities, American teachers and missionaries opened the path to an understanding of American benevolent policy through schools, religious missions, and especially, medical work. a. In Mindanao It was a part of the American strategy to make use of the local datus and leaders to promote the need for social services. The building of schools was undertaken with American super¬ vision of native workers using existing local materials. This was, for instance, illustrated by Datu Santiago of Cotabato and his men. The same was true of the campaign against insanitary living conditions and diseases especially those that frequently led to epidemics like cholera, dysentery, smallpox, and malaria. Local leaders, with only a few exceptions, helped by setting personal examples of hygiene and proper sanitation. Education of children was very much emphasized, especially those of the ruling class.

After 1918, a more sustained effort to terminate American rule would be undertaken, with the appeal for freedom taken directly by the Filipinos to Washington through the par¬ liamentary missions or legislative committees sent by the Com¬ mission of Independence. The leaders who involved themselves in this campaign had been on the Philippine political scene from 1907 — all members of the educated elite and all products of American tutelage. After two decades of American direction, these politically active Filipinos felt confident that they had sufficiently advanced in experience and participation in public affairs to enable them to manage their country on their own. The Commission of Independence In November 1918, the Philippine Legislature created the Commission of Independence “for the purpose of studying all matters related to the negotiation and organization of the in¬ dependence of the Philippines.” The Commission was given “full power and jurisdiction to act for the Philippine Legislature and represent it in all respects during the recess of said Legislature.” In March 1919, the Legislature approved a Declaration of Pur¬ poses for the guidance of the Commission. This declaration laid down the task of the Commission, which was urged to work for early independence to relieve “the anxiety of our people which two decades of occupation have only served to accentuate.” As originally organized in 1918, the Commission was com¬ posed of eleven senators and forty congressmen, including the presiding officers of both houses of the Philippine Legislature, who were to be its chairmen. Subsequently membership was"

    "content": "336 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE \nThe Third Parliamentary Mission could easily be considered \none of the most distinct of all missions because of the incidents \nattending its return to the Philippines. Shortly after the re¬ \nturn of the delegation, a bitter struggle ensued between the \nNacionalista and Democrata leadership over the Fairfield Bill. \nRecto, himself a member of the returned Mission, dramatically \ncharged the majority leaders [Quezon, Osmena, and Roxas] with \ndouble-dealing and insincerity in relation to the Fairfield Bill. \nAt Recto’s request, the Mission had unsuspectingly submitted \na report signed by the majority leaders, which maintained that \nthey had declined to accept' the Fairfield Bill and had protested \nthe approval by Washington of Governor Wood’s administration \nin the Philippines. Immediately after the report was read, Recto \nvigorously denounced the report, declaring that what the majority \nleaders had done was actually the opposite: they supported the \nFairfield Bill and promised cooperation with Governor Wood \nupon their return. He filed a minority report which charged that \nthe Mission had been unwilling to press for independence when \nthe chance was there. \nRecto’s charges seriously embarrassed the majority leaders, \nwho vehemently insisted that they did not accept the Fairfield \nBill and had demanded immediate independence. But there is very \nlittle question that Quezon changed his position on the Fairfield \nBill only after he discovered that he could not win support for \nthe measure in the Philippines. He had been willing to back off \nfrom his radical stand on independence if, while doing so, he \ncould still protect his nationalist reputation. \nThe unusual activity in 1923 and 1924 did not advance the \nindependence cause, and insofar as the Governor General was \nconcerned, he was more strongly confirmed in his powers and \nprerogatives.

    "cleaned_content": "336 HISTORY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE The Third Parliamentary Mission could easily be considered one of the most distinct of all missions because of the incidents attending its return to the Philippines. Shortly after the re¬ turn of the delegation, a bitter struggle ensued between the Nacionalista and Democrata leadership over the Fairfield Bill. Recto, himself a member of the returned Mission, dramatically charged the majority leaders [Quezon, Osmena, and Roxas] with double-dealing and insincerity in relation to the Fairfield Bill. At Recto’s request, the Mission had unsuspectingly submitted a report signed by the majority leaders, which maintained that they had declined to accept' the Fairfield Bill and had protested the approval by Washington of Governor Wood’s administration in the Philippines. Immediately after the report was read, Recto vigorously denounced the report, declaring that what the majority leaders had done was actually the opposite: they supported the Fairfield Bill and promised cooperation with Governor Wood upon their return. He filed a minority report which charged that the Mission had been unwilling to press for independence when the chance was there. Recto’s charges seriously embarrassed the majority leaders, who vehemently insisted that they did not accept the Fairfield Bill and had demanded immediate independence. But there is very little question that Quezon changed his position on the Fairfield Bill only after he discovered that he could not win support for the measure in the Philippines. He had been willing to back off from his radical stand on independence if, while doing so, he could still protect his nationalist reputation. The unusual activity in 1923 and 1924 did not advance the independence cause, and insofar as the Governor General was concerned, he was more strongly confirmed in his powers and prerogatives. The re-election of President Coolidge in 1924 ended all prospects for immediate independence. Philippine independence legislation was shelved by the Coolidge Adminis¬ tration because it felt that the Filipinos’ interest in independence was lacking in depth and sincerity, as the recent events of the Fairfield Bill had shown. The Philippine cause was also greatly hurt by the Filipinos’ continuing opposition to the Governor General.

Depression had hit American \nfarmers in 1921 and again in 1926. The world sugar market had \nbeen slumping since 1925. \nThe conviction that Philippine imports constituted a “menace” \nresulted in aggressive agitation for tariff revision in favor of \nAmerican farmers, particularly with the onset of the Depression \nin 1929. Hard-pressed agricultural groups demanded that Congress \nalleviate their desperate situation by relieving them of the burden \nof Philippine competition. If their problem could not be solved \non a tariff basis, the farmers wanted Philippine independence. \nConcurrently with the renewed attention to possible Philip¬ \npine independence, Filipino immigration to the United States \nbecame a contentious issue. The steady influx of Filipino laborers \nto the Pacific Coast states, principally California, where from \ntime to time riots had occurred over labor troubles, had led the \nAmerican Federation of Labor (AFL) and other extreme “pa¬ \ntriotic” societies to propose that the exclusion laws applicable \nto other Asians be applied to the Filipinos, who were free to \nenter the United States as they wished. \nThe AFL had been opposed to the retention of the Philip¬ \npines, having denounced it as a policy of imperialism departing \nfrom the time-honored traditions of the United States. After \n1926, when heavy Filipino immigration began, the AFL became \nchiefly concerned with the problem of Filipino immigrant labor \ncompetition, and the race problem it would create. It urged \nsupport for a policy of complete and immediate exclusion. In \n1929 the AFL argued that exclusion was also highly desirable \non the grounds of public health, since “upon the authority of \nhealth officials it is declared that the mode and conditions of life \nin the Philippines tend to destroy the vitality and stamina of \nthese people, making them easy victims of various contagious \ndiseases, as evidenced by the recent epidemic of spinal meningitis, \npneumonia, and tuberculosis.” \nFilipino exclusion was also justified on the ground that Fili¬ \npinos were the least assimilable or least desirable as additions \nto the racial composition of the American population, predo-",

With com¬ plete independence in 1946, “a brutal leap” to full tariff would be applied to Philippine exports to the United States, During the ten-year transition period there would be no reciprocal limits or duties on American products entering the Philippines - “a shocking inequality,” as some would say. “An appalling indif¬ ference to Philippine welfare,” overshadowed the “nobility” of the political provisions of the Tydings-McDuffie Act!

The economic relations then prevailing were intolerable \nsince the United States could make changes almost at will to \nsuit American interests, with the Philippines unable to defend \nits economic interests because of its political status. Quezon \nworried about congressional tinkering with the Tydings-McDuffie \nAct and felt that Philippine' Amcriean relations would be best \nstabilized by a treaty between two sovereign powers.

Directly opposed to the Spanish system which em¬ phasized, on one hand, the study of the Catholic religion, and on the other, the employment of the Philippine languages rather than Spanish as pedagogical aid* the American educational system emphasized the democratic traditions and the practical application of laws and principles. It is not, however, assumed that the American system was hostile to religion, but that this subject was optional rather than compulsory. The relegation of religion to the optional category was based on the principle of the separation of Church and State, under which the Church had no say in running the public school system. Unlike the practice of the Spanish authorities in the Philip¬ pines of discouraging the Filipinos from learning Spanish, the * Spanish was taught only to a few; the teaching of Spanish started in the second half of the nineteenth century. 371"

Water transportation, too, was developed to connect the islands of the south with the provinces of Luzon. Very little interisland shipping existed during the Spanish period, for the Spanish colonial officials were more interested in hanging about Manila than in developing the provinces economically. The in¬ terisland shipping during those days was limited to sailboats, bancas, cascos, and praus — certainly not efficient enough to promote interisland trade and commerce. With the coming of the Americans, interisland shipping was encouraged. In 1902, the American colonial government opened more than a hundred ports to domestic shipping. To protect domestic coastwise ship¬ ping the Philippine Legislature passed a law in 1923 providing that only ships owned locally could engage in interisland shipping. Progress in communication was notable. Telephone lines were introduced in Manila in 1905 and radio-telephone service in 1933. Towns and provincial capitals were linked together by telephones, telegraph lines, and radio. Mail offices throughout the country, numbering more than a thousand in 1935, handled ordinary mail, telegrams, money orders, and air mail letters and packages. The American role in the economic development of the Philippines, particularly in the field of transportation and com¬ munication, is not exactly altruistic. Doubtless, self-interest played a role that, though not obvious, was nevertheless per¬ vading. The improvement and building of roads, railways, and bridges meant importation of American tools, equipment, and materials. Good roads and bridges meant, too, importation of American trucks and cars. To make these vehicles run, im¬ portation of American oil and gasoline was imperative. Truck and automobile spare parts and tires were imported from the United States. Considering that American goods entered Philip¬ pine ports duty-free, in accordance with the Payne-Aldrich Ta¬ riff Act of 1909, it is easy to conclude that the Philippines was one of America’s greatest markets in the Orient. The American imperialists of 1898 were, therefore, justified in their clamor to take the Philippines under the wing of the American Eagle. As the history of the Philippines under the United States eloquently testifies, American altruism was engrafted with profit motive."

The “movies” have been the \npurveyor of American materialism, for they show the advan¬ \ntages of having flashy cars, mink coats, large and well-appointed \nhouses, refrigerators, television and radio sets, and such other \nappurtenances as would make for “success.” Success is meas¬ \nured in terms of material possessions. He is successful who earns \na “fast buck”; he is successful who has made millions out of \nnothing; he is successful if, in spite of his illiteracy, he wins a \ncongressional or municipal seat. The people as a rule have lost \ntheir sense of values. Values to them are those that can be turned \ninto hard cash; if they are not or can’t, they are valueless. \nThere was a time when Filipinos looked up to the poets \nand thinkers.

With the intrusion of mate¬ \nrialism, they forgot their poets and thinkers — in fact, they \nridiculed them as “fildsofos” in the sense Padre Damaso used \nthe term. Poets are now described as “patay-gutom” — dead \nhungry, worthless creatures who live in dreams of what is not. \nToday, since American influence is a continuing process, the \nFilipino is as confused as ever. The tragedy is that this con¬ \nfusion is mistaken for genius to acquire material possessions. \nFilipinos excel as imitators. But their imitation is usually \nlimited to the seamy aspect of American life. The good Amer¬ \nican traits are seldom, if ever, acquired. Here again, the “mo¬ \nvies” have played an important role. Gangsterism, juvenile de¬ \nlinquency, promiscuous love affairs, betrayal, racketeering, graft \nand corruption — all these have been brought to the Philippines \nthrough Hollywood. Not that there was no gangsterism or graft \nand corruption before, but the American films have made them \npopular. Bandolerismo or brigandage there was during the \nSpanish regime, but American gangsterism, with its display of \nmachine guns and even brilliant strategy, is something new to \nthe Filipino experience.

The average American materialism which finds expression in an inordinate love of material possessions found a virgin soil in the ordinary Filipino mind. The “movies” have been the purveyor of American materialism, for they show the advan¬ tages of having flashy cars, mink coats, large and well-appointed houses, refrigerators, television and radio sets, and such other appurtenances as would make for “success.” Success is meas¬ ured in terms of material possessions. He is successful who earns a “fast buck”; he is successful who has made millions out of nothing; he is successful if, in spite of his illiteracy, he wins a congressional or municipal seat. The people as a rule have lost their sense of values. Values to them are those that can be turned into hard cash; if they are not or can’t, they are valueless. There was a time when Filipinos looked up to the poets and thinkers. Women, too, adored them and swooned over them in the privacy of their chamber. With the intrusion of mate¬ rialism, they forgot their poets and thinkers — in fact, they ridiculed them as “fildsofos” in the sense Padre Damaso used the term. Poets are now described as “patay-gutom” — dead hungry, worthless creatures who live in dreams of what is not. Today, since American influence is a continuing process, the Filipino is as confused as ever. The tragedy is that this con¬ fusion is mistaken for genius to acquire material possessions. Filipinos excel as imitators. But their imitation is usually limited to the seamy aspect of American life. The good Amer¬ ican traits are seldom, if ever, acquired. Here again, the “mo¬ vies” have played an important role. Gangsterism, juvenile de¬ linquency, promiscuous love affairs, betrayal, racketeering, graft and corruption — all these have been brought to the Philippines through Hollywood. Not that there was no gangsterism or graft and corruption before, but the American films have made them popular. Bandolerismo or brigandage there was during the Spanish regime, but American gangsterism, with its display of machine guns and even brilliant strategy, is something new to the Filipino experience. Many of the social problems that plague Filipino society today are as much the result of the growth of urban centers as of the American “movies”. ^ ^ ^ ^"

The retreat was carried out masterfully without any sign of demoralization in the ranks. On December 24, 1941, MacArthur informed Quezon that he and some of his officials, as well as the members of his family, were to leave for Corregidor at two o’clock that afternoon. Quezon immediately called the last meeting of his Cabinet and informed them of the decision to hole up in Corregidor. Those chosen to accompany him to the island fortress were Secretary of Justice Jose Abad Santos, Vice President Sergio Osmena, General Basilio Valdes and Colonel Manuel Nieto. Jose P. Laurel, then acting Chief Justice, wanted to go with Quezon, but the latter restrained him. “No, Laurel,” the President said, “some¬ one will have to meet the Japanese. The people must be given the necessary protection. Times will be hard. A big man is needed for the job. You must stay.” Laurel, however, pointed out that the Japanese would make demands, some of them im¬ possible. “How far,” he asked, “can I go in cooperating with them?” The question was legitimate, and Quezon had General MacArthur called to answer the question. “You can do anything,” said MacArthur, “but take the oath of allegiance to the Japanese. If any one does that, I will shoot him when I return.” Then and there Laurel was sworn in as Secretary of Justice to take the place of Abad Santos. Quezon turned to the high officials of the Com¬ monwealth and gave them his last instructions: “Do the best you can. Make what bargains you have to with those people [the Japanese]. Try to keep the Philippines together in one piece. Try to protect the people from Japan's brutality and avarice."

The studied enthusiasm over the approaching independence was now climbing to its climax. On September 25, the National Assembly elected Jose P. Laurel President of the future Republic. Amidst the simulated applause and hurrahs of the Filipino audience who had no choice in the matter, the Declaration of Independence was read, the Republic inaugurated, and President Laurel inducted into office, October 14,1943. Thinking of a common effort to save the country from the tragedy that had befallen it, Laurel concluded his inaugural ad¬ dress with these words: * * * I am sure our people will rise as one to meet the challenge * * * We shall encounter difficulties greater than any we have ever faced in our national history. We shall have to adapt ourselves to the strange stimuli of a new environment and undergo the travails of constant adjustment and readjustment. God helping us, we shall march with steady, resolute steps forward, without doubt, vacci- lation or fear. There shall be no tarrying on the way, no desertion from the ranks, no stragglers left behind.

There was no safety; there were only \nfears of the unknown. Nobody could be sure that he would not \nmeet disaster in any of the streets, for the Japanese sentries, \nstrategically placed at most street comers, slapped men, women, \nand even children for failing to bow to them. The most feared \nJapanese word was kura, which meant two things to the Fili¬ \npinos depending upon the movement of the Japanese hand: a \n“Kura!” with an inward wave of the hand meant “Come here!”, \nwhich signified disaster; a “Kura!”' with an outward wave of \nthe hand meant “Dismiss!” or “Scram!” Slapping was a common \nsight. A Filipino was slapped for not bringing his residence \ncertificate with him. He was slapped for not bowing properly \nto the sentry. He was slapped for not being understood by a \nJapanese sentry. He was slapped for having a face the Japanese \ndid not like. This slapping propensity of the Japanese may be \ncommon to them and may not mean much to them, but to the \nFilipino it is an insult. To him slapping is a sign of condescension. \nHe prefers to be boxed. To slap him is to say that he is inferior \nas a man; only women, in his estimation, are slapped. And so \nthe Japanese military, who did not make any attempt to study \nFilipino psychology, failed to win the confidence and sympathy \nof the Filipinos. It is true, as the Japanese themselves suspected, \nthat almost all Filipinos were guerrillas. \nSide by side with the danger of Japanese presence was the \nspy.

There was no safety; there were only fears of the unknown. Nobody could be sure that he would not meet disaster in any of the streets, for the Japanese sentries, strategically placed at most street comers, slapped men, women, and even children for failing to bow to them. The most feared Japanese word was kura, which meant two things to the Fili¬ pinos depending upon the movement of the Japanese hand: a “Kura!” with an inward wave of the hand meant “Come here!”, which signified disaster; a “Kura!”' with an outward wave of the hand meant “Dismiss!” or “Scram!” Slapping was a common sight. A Filipino was slapped for not bringing his residence certificate with him. He was slapped for not bowing properly to the sentry. He was slapped for not being understood by a Japanese sentry. He was slapped for having a face the Japanese did not like. This slapping propensity of the Japanese may be common to them and may not mean much to them, but to the Filipino it is an insult. To him slapping is a sign of condescension. He prefers to be boxed. To slap him is to say that he is inferior as a man; only women, in his estimation, are slapped. And so the Japanese military, who did not make any attempt to study Filipino psychology, failed to win the confidence and sympathy of the Filipinos. It is true, as the Japanese themselves suspected, that almost all Filipinos were guerrillas. Side by side with the danger of Japanese presence was the spy. One may escape the brutality of the enemy, but one was confronted with the presence of spies one did not know. In his enthusiasm over the results of a naval battle, for instance, a Filipino might whisper to another the defeat of the Japanese navy. Or he might whisper, quite innocently, “The Kano are coming!” in the belief that all Filipinos were pro-Americans.

Governor Roque Ablan of Ilocos Norte refused to surrender to the enemy and withdrew to the mountains where he organized his own guerrilla unit. Captain Praeger commanded the sector between Apayao and Cagayan, while Lt. Rufino Baldwin led the underground movement in Benguet. Along the mountain trail, in and about Baguio, Bado Dangwa led his resistance fighters against the Japanese. Even¬ tually, the north Luzon guerrillas were consolidated under the over-all command of Colonel Russell W. Volckmann. However, other guerrilla units under separate commands mushroomed, principally Lapham’s guerrillas, Ramsey’s guerrillas, Ander¬ son’s guerrillas, and Colonel Claude Thorpe’s guerrillas organ¬ ization in Pangasinan and Nueva Ecija. In Central Luzon, the guerrillas flocked under the banner of several leaders, some of whom were civilians.

The “skip-and-jump” operations netted the Americans Tinian Island, which fell on August 8, the coast of New Guinea, Wake Island, which fell on May 19, Biak Island, and the Western Carolines. American territorial losses during the early phase of the war were now being recovered, and the way to the Philippines was being paved. Carrier planes softened the Japanese positions in Iwo Jima, the Palau Islands, the Peleliu and the Angar Islands. In the Southwest Pacific, MacArthur’s forces occupied Morotai Island, and struck at northern Celebes, Halmahera, Ceram, and Vogelkop. By the middle of 1944, the American forces were in a position to tighten the noose around Japan’s neck. On September 21, while Manila was listening to the Japanese-controlled Radio Station PIAM, the American carrier based planes swooped down upon the city undetected. The air attack coincided with the Japanese target practice, so that both the Japanese and the Filipinos were unaware of the presence of American planes above. Heavy damage was inflicted on Japanese installations in and around Manila, Cavite, the Japanese shipping in the bay, and troop concentrations. Similar air strikes were undertaken in the Visayas by airplanes"

The landlords improved upon \nthe techniques of their former Spanish masters and invented \nways of circumventing the Anti-Usury Law. Several techniques \nwere employed to exploit the peasant. The most notorious was \nthe takipan which consisted in paying 100% interest. The talin- \nduwa consisted m the peasant paying 50% interest on a loan; \nthe takalanan consisted in the peasant paying what he borrowed \nin kind, say, palay. If a peasant borrowed, say, fifty pesos and \nthe cost of a cavan of palay at the time the loan was made was \ntwo pesos, he had to pay his landlord twenty-five cavans at the \ntime of harvest even if the cost of the palay had risen to five \npesos per cavan. If the price per cavan dropped, the original \ntwo pesos per cavan was put into effect. In either case, the \npeasant was the loser. \nIn the pasunod, the peasant was forced to borrow from his \nlandlord whether he liked it or not. The same technique was \nemployed as in the takalanan. In the baligtaran, the palay was \nconverted into money at, say, one peso per cavan at the time \nthe loan was made.

Usury, which thrived during the Spanish regime, continued „o exist under the American rule. The landlords improved upon the techniques of their former Spanish masters and invented ways of circumventing the Anti-Usury Law. Several techniques were employed to exploit the peasant. The most notorious was the takipan which consisted in paying 100% interest. The talin- duwa consisted m the peasant paying 50% interest on a loan; the takalanan consisted in the peasant paying what he borrowed in kind, say, palay. If a peasant borrowed, say, fifty pesos and the cost of a cavan of palay at the time the loan was made was two pesos, he had to pay his landlord twenty-five cavans at the time of harvest even if the cost of the palay had risen to five pesos per cavan. If the price per cavan dropped, the original two pesos per cavan was put into effect. In either case, the peasant was the loser. In the pasunod, the peasant was forced to borrow from his landlord whether he liked it or not. The same technique was employed as in the takalanan. In the baligtaran, the palay was converted into money at, say, one peso per cavan at the time the loan was made. At harvest time, the value of the palay was increased or decreased so as to favor the landlord. Such practices added to the misery of the peasant. The realization of their lowly condition and the failure of the government to stop the caciques from their nefarious practices led to uprisings in Luzon in 1931 and in 1935. J.

They were then lodged in the San Fernando jail. They escaped, however, the following day and immediately reported the matter to Taruc. Meanwhile, the Philippine Civil Affairs Unit (PCAU) of the American Army proceeded to remove all municipal officials elected by the Huks and replaced them with USAFFE guerrillas, who were the keen rivals of the Huks. There followed a series of arrests and of disarming of the Huks; they were imprisoned by the American Counter-Jntelligence Corps (CIC). An American Air Corps Colonel, Gwen G. Atkinson, who was saved by the Huks and treated kind¬ ly, remonstrated and went to MacArthur to defend his bene¬ factors. “I don’t care even if they are communists,” he said. “I saw how they treated American flyers and I saw how the people followed them.” But he was ignored, and the mass arrest of the Huks continued. The Arrest of Taruc.—-The mass arrest of the Huks reached its peak on February 22, 1945, when the CIC arrested the mem¬ bers of the Huk General Headquarters and jailed them in San Fernando, Pampanga. One of those arrested was Luis Taruc. There was, naturally, bitterness among the peasants, for no formal charges were preferred against the Huk leaders. On March 8, the Americans released Taruc and another leader; the rest, however, were taken to Muntinglupa. A month later, on April 8, Taruc and his companion, GY (Casto Alejandrino), were re¬ arrested and jailed. They were transferred to Calasiao two days later, then to Bilibid in Manila and, finally, to Puerto Princesa, Palawan. Here Taruc mixed with the high officials of Laurel’s government who were branded collaborators by the CIC and jailed. It is significant to note that neither MacArthur nor the rival guerrilla units were able to file charges of crimes against Taruc hnd his men.

Nobody \nhas seemed to think of him; the life he leads has been the life \nhis ancestors led. There has been, since the American occupation, \na little change in his earning capacity but his purchasing power \nhas remained the same, comparatively speaking, so that actually \nthere has been negligible change for the better in his way of life. \nFor almost four hundred years he had lived the life of the \ndumb beast of burden.

Those in power have looked upon \nthis resort to arms as an aberration, a pure lunacy, and an attempt \nto seize the authority of the state by illegal means. No one in \nthe government ever thought of honestly examining the causes \nof his discontent; it was enough that he took up arms against \nthose in power to condemn him as dissident, bandit, and highway \nrobber.

For he knew that politicians were of the \nsame hue and build: they came to the barrios to pay their respects \nonly during election time in order to get some votes. He knew \nthat the politicians depended more on the urban voters than on \nthe rural ones and so he struck an attitude of indifference.

During election time, his role has been passive: during the Spanish period, he had no vote but paid burdensome taxes nevertheless; during the Amer¬ ican and the Filipino periods, he raised — and still raises — food for the nation but has been ignored by those in authority. Nobody has seemed to think of him; the life he leads has been the life his ancestors led. There has been, since the American occupation, a little change in his earning capacity but his purchasing power has remained the same, comparatively speaking, so that actually there has been negligible change for the better in his way of life. For almost four hundred years he had lived the life of the dumb beast of burden. His grievances accumulated and when a leader came around to remind him of his destitution he unbur¬ dened himself by grasping anything within reach and shedding his blood for his redemption. Those in power have looked upon this resort to arms as an aberration, a pure lunacy, and an attempt to seize the authority of the state by illegal means. No one in the government ever thought of honestly examining the causes of his discontent; it was enough that he took up arms against those in power to condemn him as dissident, bandit, and highway robber. Invariably, swift punishment is meted out to him to teach him a lesson in social cohesion, which means conformity in all respects with that the upper classes decide. The result of such a. policy has been the degradation of the tao and his acquisition of habits of thought that spell negligence, indolence, and bahala na attitude, a fatalism augmented by ignorance and religious fanaticism. The Presidential Election of 1953.HSuch, in brief, is the history of the tao. > Accustomed to being ignored, he was re¬ signed to his fate and adopted an attitude of “let alone” in polit¬ ical and social matters. When politician came around to ha¬ rangue him with rosy promises, he just smiled and said, “Oh, he’s another of those fellows...”, and refused to be drawn into the vortex of politics. For he knew that politicians were of the same hue and build: they came to the barrios to pay their respects only during election time in order to get some votes. He knew that the politicians depended more on the urban voters than on the rural ones and so he struck an attitude of indifference. For five decades since the American occupation, the tao had remained voiceless and uninfluential. And then Magsaysay came upon the scene. It is doubtful whether, as some of his public relations men"

He took time out to listen \npersonally to his grievances and took steps which would develop \nthe rural areas in a manner that would be satisfactory to the \ntao. He exhibited his tantrums to show his displeasure over \nthe way his plans for the peasants were being bungled. It was \nhis belief that by spending more time with the rural folks and \nby helping them to their feet they would, in turn, learn to help \nthemselves. His intentions, therefore, were noble, but by un¬ \nduly and openly pampering the peasants he misled them into \nbelieving that everything would be done for them by the govern¬ \nment. Thus, instead of doing things for themselves with the \nguidance and aid of the government, they came to expect Mag- \nsay say to do all for their sake whom he loved. The result was \ndisillusionment on the part of Magsaysay. He was reported to \nh?\"e exploded upon learning of the attitude of the masses, say¬ \ning: “The people want me to do everything for them!” The tao \nthus failed him, a circumstance that can be attributed to Mag¬ \nsaysay himself. In the first place, he did not warn the people \nfrom the very v inning that his administration would help them \nimprove their lot but would not be able to do everything for \nthem, specially because the administration had many prob¬ \nlems to solve. Thus forewarned the people would have less ex¬ \npectations of a magic formula to solve the ills that have plagued \nthem i'ur centuries. In the second place, Magsaysay, while sin¬ \ncere in his protestations of love for the “little man”, did not ac¬ \ntually have a blueprint for the emancipation of the masses from \npoverty. All his pians relative to the rural uplift, though im¬ \npressive to the peasants, were mere improvisations, patchwork, \na temporary expedient that meant continued alliance of the \nmasses with him. Offices were created here and there with \ngrandiose plans and promises, but many of these offices were \nnot given sufficient funds with which to carry out the policies \nof rural development to a successful conclusion. There was too \nmuch enthusiasm in laying down broad policies but less plan¬ \nning ahead. The esult was a superficial “development” of the \nbarrio, a development” that cannot be permanent owing to the \nfact that there was neither plan nor direction in the rural project. \nToday the tao is exactly where he was before Magsaysay. \nThe Election of 1957.- Magsaysay had prepared a ten-point \nprogram of administration designed to stabilize Filipino society \nwhen death overtook him in an airplane.

He took time out to listen personally to his grievances and took steps which would develop the rural areas in a manner that would be satisfactory to the tao. He exhibited his tantrums to show his displeasure over the way his plans for the peasants were being bungled. It was his belief that by spending more time with the rural folks and by helping them to their feet they would, in turn, learn to help themselves. His intentions, therefore, were noble, but by un¬ duly and openly pampering the peasants he misled them into believing that everything would be done for them by the govern¬ ment. Thus, instead of doing things for themselves with the guidance and aid of the government, they came to expect Mag- say say to do all for their sake whom he loved. The result was disillusionment on the part of Magsaysay. He was reported to h?\"e exploded upon learning of the attitude of the masses, say¬ ing: “The people want me to do everything for them!” The tao thus failed him, a circumstance that can be attributed to Mag¬ saysay himself. In the first place, he did not warn the people from the very v inning that his administration would help them improve their lot but would not be able to do everything for them, specially because the administration had many prob¬ lems to solve. Thus forewarned the people would have less ex¬ pectations of a magic formula to solve the ills that have plagued them i'ur centuries. In the second place, Magsaysay, while sin¬ cere in his protestations of love for the “little man”, did not ac¬ tually have a blueprint for the emancipation of the masses from poverty. All his pians relative to the rural uplift, though im¬ pressive to the peasants, were mere improvisations, patchwork, a temporary expedient that meant continued alliance of the masses with him. Offices were created here and there with grandiose plans and promises, but many of these offices were not given sufficient funds with which to carry out the policies of rural development to a successful conclusion. There was too much enthusiasm in laying down broad policies but less plan¬ ning ahead. The esult was a superficial “development” of the barrio, a development” that cannot be permanent owing to the fact that there was neither plan nor direction in the rural project. Today the tao is exactly where he was before Magsaysay. The Election of 1957.- Magsaysay had prepared a ten-point program of administration designed to stabilize Filipino society when death overtook him in an airplane. On March 16, 1957"

Morality had gone \ndown so low that even high government officials, from cabinet \nmembers to congressmen and senators, were constantly the fo¬ \ncus of public attention owing to rumors of illegal and immoral \ntransactions involving millions of pesos. This demoralized con¬ \ndition of Philippine society, partly hidden by attempts at corny \nspeeches on morality and so-called moral crusades on the part \nof the “pillars of society”, was ripped open when, on March \n3, 1962, then Secretary of Justice Jose W. Diokno ordered the \nNational Bureau of Investigation (NBI) agents to raid the offices \nof the Industrial and Business Management Corporation on San \nLuis Street (now Teodoro M. Kalaw St.). Arrested were Harry \nS. Stonehill, an American “Liberation” soldier turned multi¬ \nmillionaire, and his associates John L. and Robert P. Brooks. \nAt the same time that the arrests were being made, other teams \nof the NBI raided some forty widely scattered business establish¬ \nments owned by Stonehill. Seized during the raids were “enor¬ \nmous amounts of cash and a large quantity of assorted documents \nwhich could have filled three six-by-six trucks. The government \nagents also confiscated electronics devices, which included tele- \nphone-tapping instruments, tape-recording machines, a walkie- \ntalkie and a telephone-jamming device.”1 The most important \ndocument that fell into the hands of the NBI was the so-called \nBlue Book, a small orange book containing the names of persons, \nin and outside the government, who allegedly received various \nsums from Stonehill. Some congressmen, senators, cabinet \nmembers, newspapermen, and other high government officials, \nwere among those allegedly included in the Blue Book.

The Stonehill Scandal.—When Macapagal occupied Malakan- yang, he vowed he would root out graft and corruption which had plagued the government since 1945. Morality had gone down so low that even high government officials, from cabinet members to congressmen and senators, were constantly the fo¬ cus of public attention owing to rumors of illegal and immoral transactions involving millions of pesos. This demoralized con¬ dition of Philippine society, partly hidden by attempts at corny speeches on morality and so-called moral crusades on the part of the “pillars of society”, was ripped open when, on March 3, 1962, then Secretary of Justice Jose W. Diokno ordered the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) agents to raid the offices of the Industrial and Business Management Corporation on San Luis Street (now Teodoro M. Kalaw St.). Arrested were Harry S. Stonehill, an American “Liberation” soldier turned multi¬ millionaire, and his associates John L. and Robert P. Brooks. At the same time that the arrests were being made, other teams of the NBI raided some forty widely scattered business establish¬ ments owned by Stonehill. Seized during the raids were “enor¬ mous amounts of cash and a large quantity of assorted documents which could have filled three six-by-six trucks. The government agents also confiscated electronics devices, which included tele- phone-tapping instruments, tape-recording machines, a walkie- talkie and a telephone-jamming device.”1 The most important document that fell into the hands of the NBI was the so-called Blue Book, a small orange book containing the names of persons, in and outside the government, who allegedly received various sums from Stonehill. Some congressmen, senators, cabinet members, newspapermen, and other high government officials, were among those allegedly included in the Blue Book. The publication of some “big” names in the newspapers gave rise to indignation and denials, genuine or assumed, of those allegedly involved in the vast network of corruption which Stonehill skill¬ fully employed to build his business empire.

The latter was accused \nof openly supporting Marcos and other national and local can¬ \ndidates, which was in violation of the Constitution which pro¬ \nhibits any church from interfering with the affairs of th? State. \nOn the other hand, the rabid Catholics were sharply divided \ninto two camps: one supporting Macapagal and the other support¬ \ning Manglapus. The confusion in the Catholic sector was com¬ \npounded when Rufino Cardinal Santos, then in Rome issued a \nstatement advising the faithful “to vote for the sure winner.’ Many \nconstrued “the sure winner” to mean Macapagal not only be¬ \ncause he as r\\ power, but also because the Catholic lay leader \nwho flew to Rome to get the statement from the Cardinal was \nidentified with Macapagal.

The presidential campaign of 1965 was the dirtiest, the noisiest, the longest, the most expensive, and the most vicious of all political campaigns in the country. Back-stabbing, fact-twisting, mudslinging on a grand scale, and chicanery were resorted to by the rival camps to win the votes of the people. Money flowed like spring water. Rumor had it that Marcos was the fair-haired boy of the American Department of Defense, while Macapagal was painted as the fair-haired boy of the Department of State. The candidate of the Progressive Party of the Philippines, Raul Manglapus, did not escape an ugly rumor: that he was not only an “American boy” but also the candidate of the Catholic hierarchy of the Philippines. As in every election since the early 1920’s, that of 1965 was a contest of personalities and political “gimmickry”. Many Filipinos, particularly the hangers-on and the opportunists, take politics seriously not because they are politically sophisticated, but because they find in it a means of livelihood in the form of money received from the candidates and the promise of jobs — lucrative or menial, depending upon one’s capacity - - after victory at the polls. This explains the high degree of criminality during an election year: the political leaders and followers of candidates, whether for national or local positions, stake their lives on their candidates not because they love the poltticos, but because their future economic stability depends on the victory of th<ir candi¬ dates. As in the presidential election of 1957, the Catholic hier¬ archy and the indigenous Iglesia ni Kristo (Church of Chi is t) were dragged into the political cesspool. The latter was accused of openly supporting Marcos and other national and local can¬ didates, which was in violation of the Constitution which pro¬ hibits any church from interfering with the affairs of th? State. On the other hand, the rabid Catholics were sharply divided into two camps: one supporting Macapagal and the other support¬ ing Manglapus. The confusion in the Catholic sector was com¬ pounded when Rufino Cardinal Santos, then in Rome issued a statement advising the faithful “to vote for the sure winner.’ Many construed “the sure winner” to mean Macapagal not only be¬ cause he as r\\ power, but also because the Catholic lay leader who flew to Rome to get the statement from the Cardinal was identified with Macapagal. There wa* a cry of excruciating pain"

Commander Sumulong, who is still in the field, was also in favor of an amnesty for the Huks, but he emphasized that (1) the social reforms promised by Marcos must be carried out faithfully and sincerely and, (2) the Huks who would surrender must be treated as human be¬ ings and that after their surrender they must be protected by the government in such a way that nobody would take advan¬ tage of their helplessness.6 The Huk Resurgence.—The capture of Dr. Jesus Lava, the last “brains” of the original Hukbalahap, left the Huk move¬ ment destitute of ideological basis, for his successor as Supremo, Pedro Taruc, Luis Taruc’s nephew, did not come up to the in¬ tellectual level of the Lava brothers and William J. Pomeroy, a former American soldier turned Huk. Up to 1965, the Huk movement remained a myth used by the Philippine Army to justify its request for huge appropriations from Congress. What remained of the ideological Huks were mostly discontented farmers although a few of them may have continued to harbor the original Huks’ social and economic orientation. In 1965, an election year, the Huk stragglers began to show signs of life. Their field commanders, Alibasbas (Cesareo Mana- rang) and Sumulong (Faustino del Mundo) succeeded in recruit¬ ing followers. This phenomenon may be explained by the fact that the peasants of Central Luzon, the Huk territory, had again lost their faith and confidence in the government, many of whose agents were abusive and corrupt. Graft and corruption, carabao rustling, unsolved crimes involving agents of the law, and above all, the critical economic and social conditions, all of which the government had not solved satisfactorily, led many desperate and disillusioned peasants, and even men of means, to join the Huk movement. Even some landlords were alleged to have established friendly relations with the Huks who offered them 6Manila Times, August 26, 1966. Commander Sumulong obviously has a sense of history and remembered what happened to peasant leaders Juan Feleo and Jose Joven. See Chapter 25."

Our sole demand on +he leaders of North Vietnam is that they abandon their aggression * * * [Italics supplied.] Obviously, the “summiteers” were trying with difficulty to convince themselves that the North Vietnamese were the real aggressors, conveniently forgetting that they, under the leader¬ ship of the United States, were the real aggressors since they were on Vietnamese soil fighting with and for the United States and not for all the Vietnamese people. Hence their “demand” that the North Vietnamese surrender first before the “summit¬ eers” would talk peace in Vietnam. Furthermore, the state¬ ment that the seven-nation “summiteers” would continue “mili¬ tary and all other efforts... until the aggression is ended” was, to say the least, undiplomatic since the North Vietnamese con¬ sidered and still consider the “summiteers” as interlopers and therefore guilty of gross interference in the internal affairs of the Vietnamese people. It must be added that the terms “North Vietnam” and “South Vietnam” are artificial and temporary, as expressly provided in the Geneva Agreement of 1954, the dividing line between the two sectors (NOT states) being the 17th parallel. Also provided for in the Geneva Agreement was an election in Vietnam in 1956 in order to allow the Vietnamese"

Consequently, they believed that it was the \nbrusque and anti-nationalist congressmen, the intelligence agencies \nand their professional witnesses who should be investigated for \nserving allegedly alien interests, particularly, it was alleged, their \nlinks with the notorious CIA. \nWhen the intelligence agencies and their paid witnesses, \nwho, as Filipinos, are supposed to uphold and protect the na¬ \ntional interest*! above those of any other country and who are \nexpected to respect the civil liberties of the people, make un¬ \nfounded and unproved accusations which cannot stand in court, \nand when they resort to character assassination through trial \nby publicity, then, Filipino society has indeed returned to the \nDark Ages when burning at the stakes of alleged witches was \nthe rule. So dangerous is this kind of thinking of the intelligence \nagencies and some legislators that even Supreme Court Justice \nJesus G. Barrera, the mild spoken but brilliant and liberal jurist, \nin his speech ‘ Nationalism and Civil Liberties,” delivered at the \nsecond anniversary of the founding of the Kabataang Makabayan, \nheld on November 30, 1966, was compelled to issue the warning \nthat the curtailment of the militant youth movement “might \nresult in an uncontrollable overflowing that would sweep us all \nin its angry rush.” He added: \nIt seems to me that the ultimate goal of nationalism is the \nfreedom and ability of one nation to determine by itself its own \ndestiny and formulate for itself its own national policies. \nAny nation that seeks protection from or permits intervention \nby another nation in the conduct of its domestic or foreign affairs \ncannot be said to be truly independent, irrespective of its political \nstatus. In a situation such as this, the struggle for nationalism in \nthe protected or intervened state attains top priority. \nThe intelligence agencies, however, tried to salvage their \ntattered image by connecting the October 24 demonstration with \nthe youth association in China which extended an invitation to \nsome sixty students and a few professors of the U. P. to visit \nChina, all expenses paid. This squid tactics was exposed by the \nChairman of the U. P. Student Council, who said that the Red \nChinese invitation was extended after the U. P.

    "cleaned_content": "THE CONTINUING CRISIS 499 professors with a historical sense believed, rightly or wrongly, that the witch-hunt was an attempt of the anti-nationalist elements in Filipino society, acting under alien orders, to arrest the growth of the nationalist movement in order to humor the importunities of alien powers. Consequently, they believed that it was the brusque and anti-nationalist congressmen, the intelligence agencies and their professional witnesses who should be investigated for serving allegedly alien interests, particularly, it was alleged, their links with the notorious CIA. When the intelligence agencies and their paid witnesses, who, as Filipinos, are supposed to uphold and protect the na¬ tional interest*! above those of any other country and who are expected to respect the civil liberties of the people, make un¬ founded and unproved accusations which cannot stand in court, and when they resort to character assassination through trial by publicity, then, Filipino society has indeed returned to the Dark Ages when burning at the stakes of alleged witches was the rule. So dangerous is this kind of thinking of the intelligence agencies and some legislators that even Supreme Court Justice Jesus G. Barrera, the mild spoken but brilliant and liberal jurist, in his speech ‘ Nationalism and Civil Liberties,” delivered at the second anniversary of the founding of the Kabataang Makabayan, held on November 30, 1966, was compelled to issue the warning that the curtailment of the militant youth movement “might result in an uncontrollable overflowing that would sweep us all in its angry rush.” He added: It seems to me that the ultimate goal of nationalism is the freedom and ability of one nation to determine by itself its own destiny and formulate for itself its own national policies. Any nation that seeks protection from or permits intervention by another nation in the conduct of its domestic or foreign affairs cannot be said to be truly independent, irrespective of its political status. In a situation such as this, the struggle for nationalism in the protected or intervened state attains top priority. The intelligence agencies, however, tried to salvage their tattered image by connecting the October 24 demonstration with the youth association in China which extended an invitation to some sixty students and a few professors of the U. P. to visit China, all expenses paid. This squid tactics was exposed by the Chairman of the U. P. Student Council, who said that the Red Chinese invitation was extended after the U. P. Student Council had already decided to stage the now famous October 24 de-"

The Retail Trade Nationalization Act (Republic Act No. 1180) was passed in 1954 and was to take effect ten years later, on June 18, 1964, in order to give the foreign business establishments enough time to make cer¬ tain adjustments. The law provides that only Filipino corpora¬ tions, associations, and partnerships wholly owned by Filipinos can engage in retail trade. This was challenged by the Amer¬ icans who anchored their arguments on the so-called “parity” rights and, especially, in the Laurel-Langley Agreement of 1956, which extends American rights in the Philippines not only to the exploitation of the natural resources of the Philippines and its transportation business, but also to all economic activities. The Filipino nationalists challenged the validity and morality of the American contention that the Laurel-Langley Agreement and “parity” give the American corporations, partnerships, and associations more rights than the Filipinos in the latter’s coun¬ try, in that those American business establishments, even if not who'ly owned and controlled by American citizens, can en¬ gage in retail trade.

On December 16, 1966, Judge Hilarion Jarencio of the Court of First Instance of Manila ruled that the Americans and their business enterprises “are prohibited by the Retail Trade National¬ ization Law from engaging in retail business.” He cited that law’s definition of “retail trade”, which includes “sales in limited quantities to the general public of consumer goods for personal or household consumption, but also sales for industrial or com¬ mercial consumption.” Said Judge Jarencio: It does not mean that the Philippines had renounced its in¬ herent right as a sovereign state to enact laws and adopt ordinances and regulations for the sole protection of Filipino citizens, and when it does so, such a law will automatically operate in favor"

The Blue Sunday Law gives a sem¬ \nblance of leisure to the laborers, for it prohibits work on Sun¬ \ndays, Holy Thursday, Good Friday, Christmas Day, and New \nYear’s Day. The Minimum Wage Law sets the floor or minimum \nwage at P120.00 a month or not less than P4.00 a day in urban \nareas, and P2.00 daily in agricultural areas. \nThe Anti-Scab Law, passed in 1963, aims at protecting the \nworkers’ rights to strike and to picket, while another law, passed \nin 1965, amended the Minimum Wage Law by raising the mini¬ \nmum wage of P6.00 a day. \nOwing to the rapid increase of population, particularly in \nthe urban districts where provincial workers flock, and to the \nminimal industrialization which consists mainly of packaging \nhouses, the problem of unemployment is rather serious. At the \nend of 1958, about 9% or 10% of the total labor force of 8.5 \nmillion was unemployed. Equally serious is the low income of \nthe Filipino wage earners. In 1957, when the gross national \nincome was P8,799 million, only 41.5% of the amount represent¬ \ned wages and salaries of workers and employees. This index is \nlow compared with those of other countries: 49.1% for Japan \nand 58.7% for Australia.

The Blue Sunday Law gives a sem¬ blance of leisure to the laborers, for it prohibits work on Sun¬ days, Holy Thursday, Good Friday, Christmas Day, and New Year’s Day. The Minimum Wage Law sets the floor or minimum wage at P120.00 a month or not less than P4.00 a day in urban areas, and P2.00 daily in agricultural areas. The Anti-Scab Law, passed in 1963, aims at protecting the workers’ rights to strike and to picket, while another law, passed in 1965, amended the Minimum Wage Law by raising the mini¬ mum wage of P6.00 a day. Owing to the rapid increase of population, particularly in the urban districts where provincial workers flock, and to the minimal industrialization which consists mainly of packaging houses, the problem of unemployment is rather serious. At the end of 1958, about 9% or 10% of the total labor force of 8.5 million was unemployed. Equally serious is the low income of the Filipino wage earners. In 1957, when the gross national income was P8,799 million, only 41.5% of the amount represent¬ ed wages and salaries of workers and employees. This index is low compared with those of other countries: 49.1% for Japan and 58.7% for Australia. The same condition exists today (1969), but the unemployed labor force has increased dangerously. Bad Features of Philippine Labor:— On paper, it would seem that labor is united and, therefore, strong. Actually, however, Philippine labor is divided against itself owing mainly to, first, differences in principles, and second, personal ambitions of some leaders. Mergers of union have failed in the past because of the insistence of some labor leaders on a certain degree of autonomy from the parent organization, a demand that was not taken seriously by those in power.

    "content": "THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL SCENE \n549 \nThe problem of public and private education is serious. The \npublic school system is, in the words of Dr. Alfredo T. Mora¬ \nles of the University of the Philippines, “bankrupt in finances \nand values.” On the other hand, the private institutions, with \nfew exceptions, are bankrupt in values, though not in finances. \nOn the higher level, many private schools and colleges are run \nfor profit, and since profit-motive predominates over serious \neducation, faculty members are employed not because of their \ncompetence — some, however, are very competent, — hut be¬ \ncause of the low salaries they are willing to accept to keep body \nand soul together. Low salaries mean more profits for the col¬ \nleges but less learning for the students who, in many cases, are \nusually only thirty minutes behind their mentors. The net re¬ \nsult of such a system has been the increase in the number of \nunemployed graduates which, in turn, has led to grave social \nproblems. \nThe Community Schools.—One of the significant changes \nin the educational field was the introduction of the concept of \ncommunity schools. In 1948, some enterprising and resourceful \nsuperintendents of public schools started experimenting with \nthe community schools. The division superintendents of Bataan, \nBulakan, Cebu, Cagayan, Iloilo, and Pampanga began to apply \nmore thoroughly than it had been attempted before this concept \nof education by which the activities of the schools are integrated \ninto those of the community. In 1950, the convention of public \nschools superintendents adopted a program of community devel¬ \nopment through the schools. \nThe community school concept is primarily geared to the \nimprovement of the social, economic, and health conditions of \nthe rural areas. The schools use actual situations and problems \nin the community as subjects of study. The community in turn \nreceives help from the schools in the form of instructions in \nagriculture, health and sanitation, literacy, and home industries. \nNo set formulas are followed in all school divisions; the \nmethods and approach to the problems of the community de¬ \npend on the conditions of each locality. Three approaches have \nbeen evolved: the so-called Bataan approach, the Iloilo approach, \nand the Laguna approach. Each of these is named after the \nprovince where the method is employed. \nThe Bataan approach emphasizes the establishment of village \nnurseries where seedlings are distributed at nominal cost to the",

    "cleaned_content": "THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL SCENE 549 The problem of public and private education is serious. The public school system is, in the words of Dr. Alfredo T. Mora¬ les of the University of the Philippines, “bankrupt in finances and values.” On the other hand, the private institutions, with few exceptions, are bankrupt in values, though not in finances. On the higher level, many private schools and colleges are run for profit, and since profit-motive predominates over serious education, faculty members are employed not because of their competence — some, however, are very competent, — hut be¬ cause of the low salaries they are willing to accept to keep body and soul together. Low salaries mean more profits for the col¬ leges but less learning for the students who, in many cases, are usually only thirty minutes behind their mentors. The net re¬ sult of such a system has been the increase in the number of unemployed graduates which, in turn, has led to grave social problems. The Community Schools.—One of the significant changes in the educational field was the introduction of the concept of community schools. In 1948, some enterprising and resourceful superintendents of public schools started experimenting with the community schools. The division superintendents of Bataan, Bulakan, Cebu, Cagayan, Iloilo, and Pampanga began to apply more thoroughly than it had been attempted before this concept of education by which the activities of the schools are integrated into those of the community. In 1950, the convention of public schools superintendents adopted a program of community devel¬ opment through the schools. The community school concept is primarily geared to the improvement of the social, economic, and health conditions of the rural areas. The schools use actual situations and problems in the community as subjects of study. The community in turn receives help from the schools in the form of instructions in agriculture, health and sanitation, literacy, and home industries. No set formulas are followed in all school divisions; the methods and approach to the problems of the community de¬ pend on the conditions of each locality. Three approaches have been evolved: the so-called Bataan approach, the Iloilo approach, and the Laguna approach. Each of these is named after the province where the method is employed. The Bataan approach emphasizes the establishment of village nurseries where seedlings are distributed at nominal cost to the"

As a conse¬ \nquence, the poets and budding poetlings change their direction \nand try their hand at the more lucrative types: the short story, \nthe novel, and script writing. Only a few unregenerated and \nconfirmed poets, like Manuel Car. Santiago, Manuel Principe \nBautista, Ruben Vega, the late Elpidio P. Kapulong, Amado V. \nHernandez, the Veteran poet-newspaperman-labor leader, and a \nfew others, have written verses of quality. Alejandro G. Aba- \ndilla, the foremost exponent of free verse in Tagalog and who \nconsiders himself an inch above Walt Whitman, sometimes dabbles \nin poetry to prove that there is no incongruity in being an insurance \nagent and being a poet. Abadilla’s activities are not confined \nto selling insurance policies and writing poetry; he is also an \nassiduous anthologist of verses, short stories, and essays. In \n1949, after cajoling the poets into giving him their best poems, \nAbadilla put out Parnasong Tagalog, the first major anthology \nof poetry. This collection represents all schools and tendencies \nin Tagalog poetry. In a lengthy and obscure introduction, Aba¬ \ndilla laid down, in the manner of a man about to give up his \nghost, his so-called literary testament. Not contented with this \nachievement, he put out his collection of verses in 1955 and \nentitled it Ako ang Daigdig at Iba pang Tula. \nOf the postwar Filipino poets, the greatest was the late Amado \nV. Hernandez whose collections of poems Isang Dipang Langit \n(1961) and Bayang Malaya (1969) contain the most beautiful \nand significant poetry written in the Philippines. Hernandez \nwon the Republic Cultural Heritage Award and the National \nArtists Award, the latter posthumously in 1973. His death in \n1970 was a great loss to Philippine literature. \nIn the early 1960’s, some Tagalog poets resuscitated the \nold Tagalog poetic form, the tanagh; Like the Malay pantun, \nthe tanagh is a quatrain and is a poem in itself. It has seven \nsyllables to a line with a monorine, while the pantun has irregu¬ \nlar lines ranging from eight to eleven syllables to a line. Two \ncollections of tanagb have been published: Jose Villa Panganiban’s \nTanaga, Haikku, Pantum (1963) and Alejandro G. Abadilla’s \nTanagabadilla (1965). The former follows the traditional form \nand rime of the tanaga, while the latter reduces the number \nof syllables to six to a line and changes the rime schme to a b a b, \nor alternate rime. At almost the same time, a small group of \ncollege students began writing in free verse which deals realistic¬ \nally with everyday scenes and happenings. They are called the",

As a conse¬ quence, the poets and budding poetlings change their direction and try their hand at the more lucrative types: the short story, the novel, and script writing. Only a few unregenerated and confirmed poets, like Manuel Car. Santiago, Manuel Principe Bautista, Ruben Vega, the late Elpidio P. Kapulong, Amado V. Hernandez, the Veteran poet-newspaperman-labor leader, and a few others, have written verses of quality. Alejandro G. Aba- dilla, the foremost exponent of free verse in Tagalog and who considers himself an inch above Walt Whitman, sometimes dabbles in poetry to prove that there is no incongruity in being an insurance agent and being a poet. Abadilla’s activities are not confined to selling insurance policies and writing poetry; he is also an assiduous anthologist of verses, short stories, and essays. In 1949, after cajoling the poets into giving him their best poems, Abadilla put out Parnasong Tagalog, the first major anthology of poetry. This collection represents all schools and tendencies in Tagalog poetry. In a lengthy and obscure introduction, Aba¬ dilla laid down, in the manner of a man about to give up his ghost, his so-called literary testament. Not contented with this achievement, he put out his collection of verses in 1955 and entitled it Ako ang Daigdig at Iba pang Tula. Of the postwar Filipino poets, the greatest was the late Amado V. Hernandez whose collections of poems Isang Dipang Langit (1961) and Bayang Malaya (1969) contain the most beautiful and significant poetry written in the Philippines. Hernandez won the Republic Cultural Heritage Award and the National Artists Award, the latter posthumously in 1973. His death in 1970 was a great loss to Philippine literature. In the early 1960’s, some Tagalog poets resuscitated the old Tagalog poetic form, the tanagh; Like the Malay pantun, the tanagh is a quatrain and is a poem in itself. It has seven syllables to a line with a monorine, while the pantun has irregu¬ lar lines ranging from eight to eleven syllables to a line. Two collections of tanagb have been published: Jose Villa Panganiban’s Tanaga, Haikku, Pantum (1963) and Alejandro G. Abadilla’s Tanagabadilla (1965). The former follows the traditional form and rime of the tanaga, while the latter reduces the number of syllables to six to a line and changes the rime schme to a b a b, or alternate rime. At almost the same time, a small group of college students began writing in free verse which deals realistic¬ ally with everyday scenes and happenings. They are called the"

This tendency continued down to \nthe end of the American colonial period. In the mid-1930’s, \nhowever, Filipino painters, many of whom had studied in Amer¬ \nican art schools, introduced the so-called modernist concept of \nart. Victorio Edades, Diosdado M. Lorenzo, Hernando R. Ocam¬ \npo, Galo B. Ocampo, Vicente Manansala, and a few others, led \nthe “modernist” school. There was furor not only in the ranks \nof the painters themselves, but also among the laymen and critics. \nIgnacio Manlapaz, wit and art critic, and Guillermo E. Tolentino, \nthe great Filipino sculptor, — both from the University of the \nPhilippines — denounced the new trend as a hoax.

This tendency continued down to the end of the American colonial period. In the mid-1930’s, however, Filipino painters, many of whom had studied in Amer¬ ican art schools, introduced the so-called modernist concept of art. Victorio Edades, Diosdado M. Lorenzo, Hernando R. Ocam¬ po, Galo B. Ocampo, Vicente Manansala, and a few others, led the “modernist” school. There was furor not only in the ranks of the painters themselves, but also among the laymen and critics. Ignacio Manlapaz, wit and art critic, and Guillermo E. Tolentino, the great Filipino sculptor, — both from the University of the Philippines — denounced the new trend as a hoax. Edades and the two Ocampos promptly came to the defense of the “modern¬ ists” and in turn accused the “conservative” group of misunder¬ standing the nature and function of art. The “critical debate” subsided during the Japanese Occupation, but when the smoke of battle was lifted in 1945 the “modernists” found themselves enjoying a wide reputation. Composed mostly of young men and women, the “modernists,” rebelling against the alleged despotic tradition of the School of Fine Arts of the University of the Philippines, called for a creative approach to painting, maintaining that painting is not a “medium for a story or literature or any extraneous matter alien to plastic art.” This individualistic philosophy of art led to the rise of the Neo-Realist school of painting. Originally composed of Vicente Manansala, Cesar F. Le- gaspi, Hernando R. Ocampo, Romeo V.

The unequal distribution of material possessions, in \nwhich the rich wallow in wealth and the poor in filth, is one of \nthe reasons for the rise in criminality. It is true that there was, \ntoo, an unequal distribution of wealth before the war, but the \ninequality is so marked in the post-war era that its social con¬ \nsequences have been correspondingly magnified. Burglary, hold¬ \nups, robbery with murder, kidnaping, and mayhem are daily \noccurrences. There is so much moral degradation that even in \nthe national penitentiary, where convicts are supposed to change \nfor the better, the inmates turn their excess energies to “bust¬ \ning” one another’s head and to escaping under the very noses \nof their guards. Apparently, iron bars do not make a prison, \nfor those are used by the convicts precisely to escape to free¬ \ndom and to threaten society with their presence. \nPoverty has also given rise to a new class known as squatters. \nSocial mobility during the last two decades has been from the \nrural areas to urban centers. Manila and other centers of po¬ \npulation have seen this mobility and have become the focal \npoints of this movement.

The unequal distribution of material possessions, in which the rich wallow in wealth and the poor in filth, is one of the reasons for the rise in criminality. It is true that there was, too, an unequal distribution of wealth before the war, but the inequality is so marked in the post-war era that its social con¬ sequences have been correspondingly magnified. Burglary, hold¬ ups, robbery with murder, kidnaping, and mayhem are daily occurrences. There is so much moral degradation that even in the national penitentiary, where convicts are supposed to change for the better, the inmates turn their excess energies to “bust¬ ing” one another’s head and to escaping under the very noses of their guards. Apparently, iron bars do not make a prison, for those are used by the convicts precisely to escape to free¬ dom and to threaten society with their presence. Poverty has also given rise to a new class known as squatters. Social mobility during the last two decades has been from the rural areas to urban centers. Manila and other centers of po¬ pulation have seen this mobility and have become the focal points of this movement. The result is that the urban centers have become too small to accommodate the “immigrants.” The opportunities for marginal existence in the urban centers, gene¬ rated by the development of a miniature industrial complex, have been the primary factor in the movement.

In explaining why he declared martial law, President Marcos maintained that the danger of rebellion had increased and that this danger had paralyzed the functions of the national and local gov¬ ernments. The productive sectors of the economy ground¬ ed to a halt. Many schools have closed down. The judiciary is unable to administer justice. Many of our businessmen, traders, industrialists, producers and manufacturers stopped their operations. In the Greater Manila area alone, tension and anxiety have reached a point where the citizens are compelled tp stay at home. Lawlessness and criminality like kidnapping, smuggling, extortion, blackmail, armed robbery, illegal traffic in drugs, gun- running, hoarding and manipulation of prices, corruption in government, tax evasion perpetuated by syndicated criminals, have increasingly escalated beyond the capa¬ bility of the local police and civilian authorities. The President’s proclamation was met with silence by the people and the pessimist’s fear of a bloodbath did not materialize. To allay the people’s fear that the military might take over, Marcos emphasized, in a radio broadcast, that in placing the country under martial law, it was never his intention to have the military take over the civil functions of the government. “The Government of the Republic of the Philippines which was established by our people in 1946 continues,” he said. “The officials and employees of our national and local governments continue in office....” In accordance with Proclamation 1081, President Marcos issued General Order 2-A ordering the Secretary of National Defense to arrest and detain persons who committed “crimes and offenses in furtherance or on the occasion of our incident to or in connection with the crimes of insurrection and rebellion” as defined in the Revised Penal Code, and those who, in one way or another, committed and will commit crimes against society and the government, such as those involved in kidnapping, robbery, carnapping, smuggling, gun-running, trafficking of prohibited drugs and hijacking, tax evasion, price manipulation, and others guilty of weakening the fabric of society and of undermining the stability of the government."

Twenty cr so years later, during the martial law regime, Recto’s ideas, too advanced for his time, became a reality. Pres¬ ident Marcos, grasping the significance of the new realities in international politics, initiated the shift in Philippine foreign policy when, on May 23, 1975, he delivered a foreign policy speech enumerating six guidelines “to help the country survive the current security crisis in Asia” arising from the American debacle in Vietnam. The guidelines are: 1. To intensify, along with a broader field, Philippine rela¬ tions with the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN); 2. To pursue more vigorously the establishment of diplo¬ matic relations with the socialist states, particularly with the People’s Republic of China and with the Soviet Union;"

Balatbat, President of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Manager of the NAMAR- CO, and later Secretary of Commerce, delivered at the Lyceum of the Philippines, October 2, 1959, in a forum on “Economic Nationalism.” The Bell Mission Report was published in book form by the Philippine Book Co., Manila, n. d. CHAPTER XXVIII Materials for contemporary history are numerous and need to be sifted. One of the most important sources of information is periodical literature, in the present instance, The Manila Chronicle, The Manila Times, The Daily Mirror, and other papers and maga¬ zines. The treaties and agreements concluded by the Philippines with foreign countries are found in the Department of Foreign Af¬ fairs’ Treaty Series, 4 volumes, the latest, as of May 1967, being Volume IV, No. 1, 1962-1964. An exposition of Philippine foreign policy is found in then Secretary of Foreign Affairs Carlos P. Romulo’s speech delivered at the Far Eastern University on May 25, 1951, and subsequently published in pamphlet form. Fundamentals of Our Foreign Policy (Manila, 1951). Excellent counterpoints to this policy are found in many speeches of Senator Claro M. Recto, particularly his “Our Asian Foreign Policy,” an address delivered at the Arellano University on April 9, 1949, and “Our Mendicant Foreign Policy,” an address deliver¬ ed before the graduating class of the University of the Philippines on April 17, 1951. For a factual account of Philippine foreign relations, see Milton Walter Meyer’s A Diplomatic History of the Philippine Republic (Hawaii, 1965). The role of the Philippines in the United Nations is found in many issues of the official publica¬ tion of the UN, United Nations Bulletin, later on changed to United Nations Review, 1946 to date. Data on the SEATO are found in pamphlets issued by the SEATO headquarters at Bang¬ kok, Thailand, the most important of which are The SEATO Partnership (1956), The Manila Pact (USIS, n.d.), and SEATO: 1954-1959 (Bangkok, n.d.).
